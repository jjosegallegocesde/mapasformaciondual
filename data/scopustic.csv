This questions longer-term viability, creating a new perspective investigating evidence of value and impact for UK HEIs. This integrative literature review examines existing apprenticeship literature and showcases new knowledge for HEIs to update and inform future decision-making. Knowledge created offers a new framework, an “apprenticeship knowledge-based checklist model” and a perspective to explore further. Design/methodology/approach: This integrative literature review examines apprenticeship provision viability for UK HEIs across several disciplines since commencement. Findings: Analysis of selected studies across three research themes critiques potential apprenticeship practice for HEIs: stakeholder collaboration, widening participation and work-integrated learning. Results provided a new integrated perspective via governance levels: strategic, academic department, and teaching team. Research limitations/implications: The research draws from multiple disciplines representing current literature in the HEI Apprenticeships field. However, the context in which programmes are delivered by HEIs and employers differs significantly, so factors continue to emerge. Practical implications: Practical implications drawn from these findings aim to cultivate dialogue before embarking/withdrawing from HEI Apprenticeship programmes. It offers employers guidance expectations when partnering with university providers. For global apprenticeship provisions, it offers a checklist for re-valuating practice. Originality/value: The research identified new knowledge implications from existing literature in a field experiencing rapid growth. It offers valuable contributions: a knowledge-based checklist model constructed for HEIs to evaluate existing and future viability provisions at each governance level. It is a catalyst for new practice approaches and an agenda for further research. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Degree apprenticeship; Employer-university collaboration; Impact evaluation; Social inclusion; Work-based learning; Work-integrated learning","","","","","","","","Antcliff V., Baines S., Gorb E., Developing your own graduate employees: employer perspective on the value of degree apprenticeships, Higher Education, Skills and Work-Based Learning, 6, 2, pp. 378-383, (2016); Baker D., Robertshaw D., What next for end point assessments?, Higher Education, Skills and Work-Based Learning, 12, 1, pp. 78-91, (2021); Billett S., Apprenticeship as a mode of learning and model of education, Education and Training, 58, 6, pp. 613-628, (2016); The Future of Apprenticeships in England, (2016); Bradley J., Newhouse C., Mirza N., Driving social mobility?

In Mexico, the so-called Modelo Méxicano de Formación Dual has been adapted to Mexico's cultural conditions. Yet, it still seems to be largely unknown in society, the education system and the labour market. Attitudes, perceptions or so-called ‘social representations’ are culturally anchored in a society and can be identified in artefacts and individual narratives. Especially social representations of company gatekeepers, such as human resources employees are focused because they regulate access in companies and to higher positions. Although this happens on the basis of organizational transition policies, decision-making processes are shaped by culturally anchored individual perceptions. The target group of company gatekeepers from the tourism sector was interviewed within the framework of a qualitative study during eight semistructured ‘face-to-screen’ interviews, analysed according to grounded theory methodology. Based on social representation analysis, the Mexican labour market seems to be dichotomized. Academic titles have a high symbolic value, promising prestige. TVET options are given little focus, lack a high social esteem and are still largely unknown. Those produce técnicos, while holders of oficos often do on-the-job training within their families. Both depend upon their employers and have to accept unfavourable working conditions. This implies physically demanding, often gender-specific work. Promotions are possible, even without academic degrees. Because of a lack of institutionalization, these are subjective, depending on the goodwill of company gatekeepers. Promotions are possible to a certain extent, so nonacademic workers are facing a glass ceiling. © 2022 The Authors.

School and workplace education offer different environments and social experiences for learners. Participation in practical tasks in companies and project-oriented work helps to acquire skills that are less developed in the education system, specifically the soft skills and the work culture. Dual training is a response to the need for students to develop these non-cognitive skills during their placements, while at the same time gaining up-to-date work and technical experience. How has the situation of dual training in engineering education at Óbuda University evolved since 2015, the period since the launch of dual education? In the past 8 years, both the partner companies and the university have accumulated a remarkable amount of experience.

Design/methodology/approach: The current research concentrates on the study of the limitations and prospects of the use of remote educational technologies for dual education in Russian practice in pandemic conditions. The introduction of remote technologies into the educational process was assessed from the perspective of context, resources used, process, and outcome. In order to assess the feasibility of distance learning, this work used a direct subjective methodology, as well as a situational analysis method. Findings: The research reveals the essence of a dual approach to engineering education, which is based on the direct participation of enterprises in the educational process. Features of application of remote technologies of training in training of engineering personnel are disclosed. The specifics of emergency introduction of remote learning technologies in the training of engineering personnel at the basic department in pandemic conditions are shown. The peculiarities of introduction of perceptions of teachers and students in the educational process of distance learning, namely its context, input resources, process, and product, were analyzed. The results of the analysis showed that both teachers and students of the basic department that trains engineering personnel have sufficient digital skills, which almost unhindered contributed to the emergency introduction of remote technologies. On the other hand, practical training in the basic department involves the use of unique equipment and direct personal communication between teachers and students, which is an objective obstacle to the introduction of the most common remote technologies at present. Originality/value:: The presented research of the features of the introduction of distance learning technologies in pandemic conditions allows assessing their usefulness for dual engineering education, and also indicates the key advantages and disadvantages of their use in the training of engineering personnel. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","COVID-19; Distant learning; Dual education; Emergency remote teaching; Engineer training","","","","","","","","Ahmed N., Osman A., The Acceptance and Use of Information and Communication Technologies by Staff Members in Khartoum State’s Universities (Sudan), (2014); Ashimova Z., Tukenova K., Prospects for dual training as an innovative method of training in the field of technical and vocational education, Current Research in the Modern World, 10-5, 54, pp. 14-18, (2019); Brooks E., Morse R., Methodology: Best online engineering programs rankings, Jan., (2018); Chuchalin A., Engineering education in the era of the industrial revolution and digital economy, Higher Education in Russia, 27, 10, pp. 47-62, (2018); Douglas K., Ionescu D., Petrolito J., Mainali B., Is blended learning the answer to enhance learning of engineering students?, Proceedings of International Conference on Engineering Education and Research, pp. 21-24, (2016); Flek M., Ugnich E., Development of human capital of the enterprise in conditions of improvement of the system of personnel training.

In this chapter, we aimed to classify the European VET systems into similar groups (countries) using two indicators and statistical analysis. The first indicator (dimension) was the share of upper secondary students undertaking vocational programmes. The second indicator (dimension) was the percentage of VET students enrolled in programmes combining a work-based and school-based component as opposed to VET programmes which are basically schoolbased. VET programmes account for sizeable shares of upper secondary enrolments in the Czech Republic and Slovakia but they are basically school-based, as opposed to Denmark and German-speaking countries where the dual VET system (also known as apprenticeship programmes) is part of the post-compulsory education system. © 2022 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","","","","","","","","","Attwell G., New roles for vocational education and training teachers and trainers in Europe: A new framework for their education, Journal of European Industrial Training, 21, 6-7, pp. 256-265, (1997); Billett S., Overview: The technical and vocational education and training profession, International Handbook of Education for the Changing World of Work, pp. 1175-1184, (2009); Bonoli G., Wilson A., Bringing firms on board.

These reforms, promoted by the European Union, have used the Central European dual model as the reference. However, this transfer is accompanied by processes of adoption, adaptation and transformation in its implementation, where different challenges and difficulties arise among the actors involved. This article is based on a systematic literature review of the challenges and difficulties faced jointly by the public and private sectors in the implementation of the dual model. It follows the PRISMA protocol and the proposals of O'Neill & Booth (2017) for the use of Nvivo in systematic reviews. The search and creation of the bibliographic corpus was carried out through WoS-Main Collection, Scopus and ProQuest.The results systematise the challenges and difficulties that the scientific literature on public-private partnerships for the proper functioning of dual VET, which are key to the implementation processes. These revolve around access, network cooperation, curriculum development, the tension between productivity and training and the response to economic downturns.The literature reviewed warns us that any attempt to reform VET along the lines of the Central European dual model entails multiple contextual challenges which make a direct transfer difficult. Social dialogue emerges as a fundamental tool for successful implementation. © 2023 Journal of Degraded and Mining Lands Management","dual apprenticeships; education reform; social dialogue; systematic review; Vocational education and training","","","","","","","","Aleman-Falcon J.

Specifically, it aims to analyse and compare the labour market success of graduates of different tracks at the ISCED 3 level in both early and later stages of their careers. The comparison is based on the analysis of PIAAC 2013 OECD study data. A composite multidimensional indicator was constructed to measure labour market success and subsequently used as a dependent variable in regression models. The results indicate that in the systems with dual IVET at the ISCED 3 level (Germany and Austria), graduates are indeed more successful at the labour market than their counterparts with other ISCED 3 tracks. However, their advantage diminishes in later stages of the career. Additionally, in Austria, the success of dual education young graduates is mediated by individual characteristics. In the system with only school-based IVET (the Czech Republic), this track does not guarantee substantively higher labour market success for young graduates compared to other ISCED 3 tracks and also to those with lower education. Czech apprentices in the later stages of career succeed even less than those with below ISCED 3 education. © 2021 The Author(s).

Louis Pasteur, 25, Málaga, 29010, Spain","In the search for solutions to national skill formation challenges, the central and northern Europeans models of good practices in dual vocational education and training (VET) permeated the imaginary of the southern countries. Particularly, the German dual VET system has been predominant in the discourse of policy-makers. This research analyses the role played by the European Union (EU) in the promotion of this model as the reference for the reforming Member States during the policy transfer stage of cross-national attraction. This paper develops a reflexive Thematic Analysis among the fundamental documentation related to VET resulting from the EU Governance Triangle. Its aim is to interpret the EU proposal for the reform of VET, with a focus on the characteristics which shape the way in which the training is developed. This Thematic Analysis reveals that the EU promotes a VET training model based in work-based learning as a pillar, preferably articulated in the form of apprenticeships. This, along with the general principles for the regulation of apprenticeships promoted by the EU, proves the agency role exercised by the EU in the dissemination of dual VET as a model of good practice. © 2022 The Author(s).

SPFS, Rome, Italy","This chapter illustrates the relevance that smart learning ecosystems can assume in the education of smart citizens, considered as indispensable agents of the development of the smartness of the cities. Starting from the description of an alternative model of smart city—i.e., a people-centered one in which the smartness of the city and the citizens’ well-being can be identified as a multidimensional construct to the development of which the citizens themselves should actively contribute—we come to the definition of the space of competences that smart citizens should acquire. Therefore, we describe the subspaces that compose the main space—hard, life/soft and digital soft digital competences—together with their interdependencies and the transformations that the framework could undergo due to the continuous technological evolution. Finally, smart learning ecosystems, consisting of one or more schools linked to the context of reference and to their stakeholders by territorial pacts aimed at fostering regional development and social innovation, are identified as the elective contexts capable to train future smart citizens. Case studies of alternation schemes aimed at the development of the expected competences by students are provided, together with an overview on the associated process of micro-certification and, as well, some final warnings. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Alternation schemes; Dual education; Ecosystem smartness; LIFE skills; People-centered smart cities; Smart citizens; Smart leaning ecosystems; Soft digital competences; Space of competences","Ecosystems; Education computing; Regional planning; Alternation scheme; Dual education; Ecosystem smartness; Learning ecosystems; LIFE skill; People-centered smart city; Smart citizen; Smart leaning ecosystem; Soft digital competence; Space of competence; Smart city","","","","","","","Unindustria, (2019); Chatterton P., Rebbeck G., Technology for Employability, JISC, (2015); Concilio G., Rizzo F., Human Smart Cities.

The government funds both public and private schools. Parents have much freedom to set up schools to realize their religious ideals. The freedom of education enshrined in the Dutch Constitution is controversial. The question has arisen as to whether the government should fund private schools. This paper describes what the Dutch freedom of education entails, gives an overview of educational ideals and mentions some areas where freedom of education is under threat. The conclusion is that although schools still have a great deal of freedom, this is decreasing, and alertness is required. © The Author(s) 2023.","admission policy; citizenship education; educational ideals; freedom of education; orthodox Protestant schools; reformed ideals; sexual education","","","","","","","","Bertram-Troost G.D., Menswording in een laag-vertrouwensamenleving.

Because there are no reliable objective markers of concussion, self-reporting of subjective and non-visible symptoms are critical to ensuring proper concussion management. For this reason, educational interventions target concussion reporting, but the majority of studies have examined the efficacy of single educational interventions or compared interventions to one another. This randomized crossover study sought to identify whether there was benefit to administering multiple concussion education programs in tandem, back to back. The study randomized 313 male high school football players to first receive CrashCourse concussion education (CC) or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention video concussion education (CDC) followed by crossover with the other education. Athlete concussion-reporting intention, attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and enjoyment of education were assessed at baseline and after each intervention. There were statistically significant improvements across all measures, both after single intervention and crossover (all p < 0.001). Secondary analyses examining differences between education found that athletes reported higher enjoyment of concussion education immediately after participating in CC, as compared to CDC (p < 0.001). These findings demonstrate an additive benefit to implementing CC and CDC education in tandem, without decrement in enjoyment of concussion education after experiencing dual educations; in fact, enjoyment of concussion education improved after receiving education programs back to back. These educational programs appear to complement one another, and the results support the use of multi-modal concussion education to differentially target and maximize concussion reporting.  © Daniel H.

Design/methodology/approach: Focus group discussions are conducted to reveal the perceptions and experiences of the apprentices in the i-Ready programme. The SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis framework is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the i-Ready apprenticeship model in building a future-ready human capital. Findings: The study found that the JobCentre agency utilises online recruitment technology and proactively promotes work-based training in the public and private sectors. However, the apprenticeship still needs to improve programme coordination and provide an inclusive regulatory framework. The study also discovered that internships could enhance in-demand skills training and establish apprentices as a crisis-recovery workforce. Research limitations/implications: The findings are based on a small-scale focus group study and represent the current state of the i-Ready programme. Future research integrating data from multiple stakeholders is recommended to provide a more thorough picture. Practical implications: In terms of efficacy, the findings indicate that i-Ready has made significant contributions to local employment and, with certain modifications, is on the correct route to producing future-ready youth. Originality/value: To date, there has been no research on the effectiveness of the national i-Ready programme system as a strategy that may help alleviate Brunei's youth unemployment crisis. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Apprenticeship; Capability-building; Unemployment; Upskilling; Youth employability","","","","","","National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, (R01MH111416); National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NINDS, (R01NS078095)","","Achatz J., Jahn K., Schels B., On the non-standard routes: vocational training measures in the school-to-work transitions of lower-qualified youth in Germany, Journal of Vocational Education and Training, 1-22, (2020); Bakar R., Brunei seeks to fill 13,000 skilled jobs in next five years, The Scoop, (2020); Bakar R., 4,000 MSMEs and youths offered digital skills training, The Scoop, (2020); Bandial A., Zainuddin H., Brunei to enter endemic phase on December 15, The Scoop, (2021); Beblawi H., The Rentier State in the Arab world, The Rentier State, (1990); Vocational education and training in Europe: Germany, BIBB - Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training, (2019); Vocational education and training in Germany: short description, Publications Office of the European Union, (2020); Brunei economic outlook 2021, Bandar Seri Begawan: Centre for Strategic and Policy Studies, (2021); Brunei economic outlook 2022, Bandar Seri Begawan: Centre for Strategic and Policy Studies, (2022); Chacaltana J., Dasgupta S., Is the Future Ready for Youth?

But even a brief review in this area makes it possible to clearly trace the dependence of the development of the archivist's profession on changes that are taking place in the society and utilized information technologies. The article notes that the formation of a professional training system is largely determined by the development of historical science and historical archives in general. Moreover, the creation of the archival education system begins ""top-down"", with the creation of the highest level of professional training - as a specialization within the framework of classical university education. This approach does not allow adapting the archivist training system to the real needs of the industry. The paper thus focuses on the importance of dual training of specialists who are willing to work in archives. © 2021 International Institute for Archival Science Trieste - Maribor.

One of the most important tasks of the modern education system in Russia is the search for organizational forms that can meet the needs of the labor market, solve the problem of providing enterprises, especially high-tech ones, with personnel with deep fundamental knowledge and relevant practical skills. The answer to this request is the development of a dual education system that takes into account the modern realities of socio-economic development. The purpose of the work is to study the development of forms of organization of interaction between enterprises and educational organizations within the framework of dual education. Materials and methods. In order to study the significance and prospects for the development of the dual education system, a retrospective and comparative analysis, an ecosystem approach were used. The study involved 98 graduates of one of the basic departments of the Don State Technical University (Russian Federation), who studied from 2003 to 2020 and are currently working at a partner enterprise. For the purpose of comparative analysis and confirmation of the hypothesis about the impact of training at the basic department on the acceleration of professional adaptation, two groups of employees (35 people each) with work experience from three to ten years were also interviewed: those who studied at this department and those who did not study at it. The method of group expert assessments, questionnaires, the Mann-Whitney U-test are applied Results. A survey of employees of a large Russian industrial enterprise who studied at the basic department and did not study at it showed that the average period of professional adaptation of the first was about 4.9 months, which is more than twice less than the same period in the group of those who did not study at it. Similarly, the period of perception of the corporate culture of the enterprise: for those who studied at the basic department, it is more than two times shorter than for those who did not study at it. Both groups of respondents rated the importance of mentoring for young workers by 5 points on a 5-point scale. The Mann-Whitney U-criterion for assessing the period of professional adaptation is 108.5, for assessing the perception of corporate culture - 86.5 (at U0.01=413; U0.05=471). Conclusion. The results of the study allow us to conclude about the significance of the accumulated experience in the development of the domestic dual education system and its key institutional unit - the basic department at the partner enterprise. The prospects for the development of dual education are seen in the dissemination of the principle of lifelong learning. This principle presupposes the formation of a new model of dual education as part of a vocational education ecosystem that allows taking into account current and prospective personnel requirements of enterprises. © 2022 LLC Ecological Help.

The dual vocational education and training exists in Germany, Austria and Switzerland and stands for regional competitiveness as well as for job opportunities of young people on the local labour market. Outside of these three countries, the dual system hardly exists, but dual practices are subject of international skill transfer policies. While this transfer is well researched, it is hardly known to what ex-tent (in mirror image) subsidiaries of foreign companies take part in the dual system of German speaking countries. This question was examined, by focussing on subsidiaries of multinational companies in Germany. Theoretically, the contribu-tion relates to research on local knowledge bases and the em-beddedness of foreign subsidiaires. The study pursues a qualitative method. The results show that the local training managers have freedom for decision-making and use this in favour of getting involved in dual vocational education and training. However, the effort turns out to be high. Dual activities take place primarily as a strategy for adapting to the institutional environment, not as a way of shaping the environment. The local stakeholders are mostly reactive in this regard. This points to possible future fields of research on local knowledge bases and local embeddedness and, with regard to practice, to the relevance of mutual coordination. © 2022 by the author(s).","Dual vocational education and training; Foreign direct investment; Germany; Local embeddedness; Local knowledge base","","","","","","German Scientific Foundation; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (FU 424/17-1, PI 418/7-1)","Funding We gratefully acknowledge the support of the research project “Multinational companies and local knowledge base—an evolutionary perspective: Regional variants of initial vocational education and training activities in Germany” by the German Scientific Foundation (DFG Grants No. FU 424/17-1 and PI 418/7-1).","Amin A., Thrift N., Living in the Global, Globalization, Institutions, and Regional Development in Europe, pp. 1-22, (1995); Anderson P., Warhurst C., Lost in translation?

As of 2021, approximately 630 physicians in the United States were board-certified in both HPM and Hem/Onc. There is increasing demand for an integrated fellowship pathway, and the inaugural integrated fellowship Match took place in 2022. We present the historical context of the overlap in HPM and Hem/Onc fellowship training, limitations of the standard training paradigm, and an overview of the recently developed integrated training pathway accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). We explore applications of dual training in clinical care, program development, and research at the intersection of HPM and Hem/Onc. Finally, we consider challenges to the success and how best to assess the outcomes of this program. Integrated fellowship training in HPM and Hem/Onc is 1 avenue to develop a cohort of dual-trained physicians poised to effect broad cultural change in this important and evolving space. A subset of physicians with dual training has the potential to fill unmet needs by promoting enhanced patient-centered care, developing infrastructure for heightened collaboration between these distinct but closely related fields, and prioritizing research focused on advanced communication skills and symptom management for patients with cancer. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Advancing Innovation in Residency Education (AIRE); Fellowship training; Hematology and medical oncology; Medical education; Palliative medicine","","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (T32HL007899-23); Bristol-Myers Squibb Foundation, BMSF","Ramy Sedhom receives grant funding from the Bristol Meyers Squibb Foundation .

We proposed an approach exploring the feasibility of leveraging machine learning to tailor apprenticeship programs and enhance learning outcomes. The proposed approach involves the collaboration of four key stakeholders, namely, the employer, trainer, university management, and apprentice, each with unique roles in the apprenticeship program. A machine learning algorithm is employed to customize Occupational Learning Outcomes (OLO) for each job, with the use of blockchain technology to facilitate the student credit system. The entire system is hosted on a cloud-based centralized database to enable dynamic and sustainable program modification. The paper concludes by highlighting the potential of digital technologies to transform apprenticeships and create new opportunities and challenges. © 2023 IEEE.","apprenticeship programs; digital technologies; machine learning; personalized learning; transform education","Commerce; E-learning; Employment; Engineering education; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Academic pursuit; Apprenticeship programs; Cloud-based; Digital technologies; Labour market; Learning outcome; Machine-learning; Market demand; Personalized learning; Transform education; Apprentices","","","","","Mohammed Bin Rashid Smart Learning Grants, (P02200140); British University in Dubai, BUiD","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research is funded by Mohammed Bin Rashid Smart Learning Grants (MBRSLG) [Grant Number P02200140 - Adopting the Course Complexity & Cognitive Analysis in STEM education to Enhance the Employability Matrix: Developing a micro-credential AI System] in a joint collaboration between Higher Colleges of Technology(HCT), and the British University in Dubai (BUiD), United Arab Emirates.","Gigauri I., Gulua E., Mushkudiani Z., Current advances in digital recruitment of human resources and its potential for companies.

Its driving forces are Industry 4.0 technologies, which result in radical changes in all areas of life. This also affects the spheres of the triple helix (university-industry-government) and how they cooperate. Based on various databases and qualitative research, the main goal of the study is to explore these changes in the field of higher education in technical vocations. We will also examine how all this affects the geography of Hungarian industry. Analysing the description of the technical courses, we have identified a new course (mechatronics engineering) and a new form of training (dual training) as a response to the new technological challenges. German companies, which are at the forefront of the application of Industry 4.0 technologies, have not only encouraged the introduction of dual training, but also the cooperation between the spheres. This is evaluated from the perspective of a multi-site German company (Continental) and a university (the University of Miskolc) using the example of mechatronics engineering training to present the major characteristics of cooperation in connection with new technologies. The main result and novelty of the study is that it points out that the changes in the spheres of the triple helix and their cooperation, which were also motivated by the technological revolution, can also reshape the spatial structure of Hungarian industry. © 2023, Erdkunde.

A characteristic feature of technologies in the 2030 Horizon is their volatility, and that of competencies and the complexity of the problems to be solved when incorporating the multidimensionality of sustainable objectives. Therefore, by taking into account the achievement of the SDGs proposed by the United Nations, a new fractal model of organization of dual educational practice is proposed, which, together with the concept of fractality, enables the integrated organisation of academic, professional and dual education. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Competencies; Complex adaptive systems (CAS); Dual educational model (DEM); Industry 5.0; KETs; Simplexity educational engineering model (SEEM); Sustainable engineering","","","","","","","","de Miranda S., Aguayo-Gonzalez F., Salguero-Gomez J., Avila-Gutierrez M.J., Life cycle engineering 4.0: A proposal to conceive manufacturing systems for Industry 4.0 centred on the human factor (DfHFinI4.0), Appl Sci, 10, (2020); Fernandez-Miranda S.S., Marcos M., Peralta M.E., Aguayo F., The challenge of integrating Industry 4.0 in the degree of mechanical engineering, Procedia Manuf, (2017); ManuFUTURE vision 2030 a competitive, Sustainable and Resilient European Manufacturing, (2018); Jobs lost, Jobs Gained: Workforce Transition in a Time of Automation, (2017); Jeganathan L., Khan A.N., Kannan Raju J., Narayanasamy S., On a Frame Work of Curriculum for Engineering Education 4.0.

In 2013, the ‘European Alliance for Apprenticeships’ was launched. In Germany, a role model for apprenticeship training in Europe, a national ‘Alliance for Initial and Further Training’ was signed just one year later. Both Alliances represent a new, experimentalist governance mode, in which a novel steering entity orchestrates stakeholder cooperation. What explains the parallel evolvement of alliances for apprenticeships in Germany and at the EU level? Studying developments around the Alliances in the last two decades, we trace and critically discuss four theorised drivers: (1) German-driven VET governance reforms with a strong influence of German best practices, (2) EU-driven cooperation that influences German VET policies, (3) cross-fertilising reforms and (4) externally driven, parallel reforms in response to governance mega-challenges. Our analysis supports a prevalence of the fourth driver: increasingly complex policy problems push both the EU and Germany to implement policy innovations such as the Alliances for apprenticeship training. In an experimentalist setting that often entails a governance by (seemingly neutral) numbers, benchmarking and learning, this also gives leeway to Germany to present itself as a pioneer of the EU’s focus on dual training. © The Author(s) 2023.","alliance for apprenticeships; Education governance; European Union; experimentalist governance; vocational education and training","","","","","","","","Allianz für Aus- und Weiterbildung 2019-2021, (2019); Allianz für Aus- und Weiterbildung. 14.

However, few studies have examined the perceptions and importance of role tensions in this particular context. Accordingly, this contribution focuses on the role stress perceived by dual apprentices through a questionnaire survey. Latent profile analyses allowed to distinguish four apprentices’ profiles in terms of perceptions of role stress, ranging from minimal to prominent role stress. Differences in socio-demographic characteristics, motivation for choosing the training, professional identification, and intention to terminate the apprenticeship contract were also identified. The study provides information on the importance of considering apprentices as a heterogeneous population in terms of role stress, but also on the different motivational and identity issues associated with the profiles. Discussing such issues would also improve the learning experience. © 2021 AIPTLF","Dual apprenticeship; Illegitimate tasks; Latent profile analysis; Quality of vocational education and training; Role stress","","","","","","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF, (100019_175880)","Le projet est financé par le Fonds national suisse de la recherche scientifique (100019_175880).","Adams K., Hean S., Sturgis P., Clark J.M., Investigating the factors influencing professional identity of first-year health and social care students, Learning in health and social care, 5, 2, pp. 55-68, (2006); Alves S., Gosse B., Sprimont P.A., Dimensions et conséquences de la satisfaction au travail des apprentis, Revue internationale de psychosociologie, 16, 40, pp. 161-180, (2010); Arras-Djabi M., Jeannerod-Dumouchel N., Lanoe L., L'apport des tensions de rôle dans l'ingénierie des espaces de discussion-Recherche-intervention chez Enedis, Revue française de gestion, 47, 295, pp. 39-63, (2021); Asparouhov T., Muthen B., Using Mplus TECH11 and TECH14 to test the number of latent classes, Mplus Web Notes, 14, (2012); Berger J.-L., Wenger M., Sauli F., How the perceived quality of in-company training matters: A study with apprentices in technical and retail occupations, Pedagogical concerns and market demands in VET.

The sample comprises 43 German vocational education and training (VET) trainees in various apprenticeship programs. During the diary period of ten working days, the participants were instructed to record five typical social interactions at work every day. Quantitative data of 1,328 social interactions were analyzed by means of multilevel analysis. Regarding social interactions’ characteristics, the analysis revealed the baseline level of instrumentality, an interruption of the social interaction, its instrumentality and questions asked by the trainee during the interaction as positive predictors of self-perceived learning. A trainee’s higher speech proportion, however, was a negative predictor. Regarding state emotions, the emotional experiences of bored and motivated were identified as significant positive predictors of learning from social interactions at work. Emotions’ baseline level as well as personality traits had no significant influence. The results indicate that social interactions’ situational characteristics have the biggest influence on self-perceived learning from social interactions. © 2022, The Author(s).","Diary study; Emotions; Informal learning; Personality; Social interaction; Workplace learning","","","","","","Universität Mannheim, UMA","","Bandura A., Social Learning Theory, General Learning Press, (1971); Barrick M.R., Mount M.K., The big five personality dimensions and job performance: A meta-analysis, Personnel Psychology, 44, pp. 1-26, (1991); Beatty B.R., Seeing workplace learning through an emotional lens, The SAGE Handbook of Workplace Learning, pp. 341-355, (2011); Benozzo A., Colley H., Emotion and learning in the workplace: Critical perspectives, Journal of Workplace Learning, 24, 5, pp. 304-316, (2012); Billett S., Learning in the workplace: Strategies for effective practice, Allen & Unwin, (2001); Billett S., Learning through work: Workplace affordances and individual engagement, Journal of Workplace Learning, 13, 5, pp. 209-214, (2001); Billett S., Toward a workplace pedagogy: Guidance, participation, and engagement, Adult Education Quarterly, 53, 1, pp. 27-43, (2002); Billett S., Workplace participatory practices: Conceptualising workplaces as learning environments, Journal of Workplace Learning, 16, 6, pp. 312-324, (2004); Billett S., Emerging perspectives on workplace learning, Emerging Perspectives of Workplace Learning, pp. 1-15, (2008); Billett S., Learning through practice, Learning Through Practice: Models, Traditions, Orientations and Approaches, pp. 1-20, (2010); Bolger N., Davis A., Rafaeli E., Diary methods: Capturing life as it is lived, Annual Review of Psychology, 54, pp. 579-616, (2003); Bono J.E., Foldes H.J., Vinson G., Muros J.P., Workplace emotions: The role of supervision and leadership, The Journal of Applied Psychology, 92, 5, pp. 1357-1367, (2007); Carmeli A., Brueller D., Dutton J.E., Learning behaviours in the workplace: The role of high-quality interpersonal relationships and psychological safety, Systems Research and Behavioral Science, 26, 1, pp. 81-98, (2009); Cerasoli C.P., Alliger G.M., Donsbach J.S., Mathieu J.E., Tannenbaum S.I., Orvis K.A., Antecedents and outcomes of informal learning behaviors: A meta-analysis, Journal of Business and Psychology, 33, 2, pp. 203-230, (2018); Collin K., Valleala U.M., Interaction among employees: How does learning take place in the social communities of the workplace and how might such learning be supervised?, Journal of Education and Work, 18, 4, pp. 401-420, (2005); Csikszentmihalyi M., The flow experience and its significance for human psychology, Optimal experience: Psychological Studies on Flow in Consciousness, pp. 15-35, (1988); Daniels K., Boocock G., Glover J., Holland J., Hartley R., An experience sampling study of learning, affect, and the demands control support model, The Journal of Applied Psychology, 94, 4, pp. 1003-1017, (2009); Deci E.L., Ryan R.M., Intrinsic motivation and self-determination in human behavior, (1985); Dehnbostel P., New learning strategies and learning cultures in companies, International Handbook of Education for the Changing World of Work, pp. 2629-2645, (2009); Eddy E.R., D'Abate C.P., Tannenbaum S.I., Givens-Skeaton S., Robinson G., Key characteristics of effective and ineffective developmental interactions, Human Resource Development Quarterly, 17, 1, pp. 59-84, (2006); Ellinger A.D., Cseh M., Contextual factors influencing the facilitation of others' learning through everyday work experiences, Journal of Workplace Learning, 19, 7, pp. 435-452, (2007); Ellstrom P.-E., Informal learning at work: Conditions, processes and logics, The SAGE Handbook of Workplace Learning, pp. 105-119, (2011); Enders C.K., Tofighi D., Centering predictor variables in cross-sectional multilevel models: A new look at an old issue, Psychological Methods, 12, 2, pp. 121-138, (2007); Engestrom Y., Expansive learning at work: Toward an activity theoretical reconceptualization, Journal of Education and Work, 14, 1, pp. 133-156, (2001); Eraut M., Non-formal learning and tacit knowledge in professional work, British Journal of Educational Psychology, 70, pp. 113-136, (2000); Eraut M., Informal learning in the workplace, Studies in Continuing Education, 26, 2, pp. 247-273, (2004); Eraut M., Learning from other people in the workplace, Oxford Review of Education, 33, 4, pp. 403-422, (2007); Eraut M., Knowledge, working practices, and learning, Learning Through Practice: Models, Traditions, Orientations and Approaches, pp. 37-58, (2010); Feldman Barrett L., Discrete emotions or dimensions?

The underlying pathophysiology of aviation DCS is the same as that of diving-related. However, based on the innate multifactorial circumstances surrounding hypobaric DCS, in clinical practice it continues to be unpredictable and less familiar as it falls at the intersect of aerospace and hyperbaric medicine. This retrospective study aimed to review the case series diagnosed as aviation DCS in a collaborative effort between aerospace specialists and hyperbaricists to increase appropriate identification and treatment of hypobaric DCS. METHODS: We identified 18 cases involving high-performance aircraft emergently treated as aviation DCS at a civilian hyperbaric chamber. Four reviewers with dual training in aviation and hyperbaric medicine retrospectively reviewed cases and categorized presentations as “DCS” or “Alternative Diagnosis”. RESULTS: Reviewers identified over half of presenting cases could be attributed to an alternative diagnosis. In events that occurred at flight altitudes below 17,000 ft (5182 m) or with rapid decompression pressure changes under 0.3 atm, DCS was less likely to be the etiology of the presenting symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: A viation physiological events continue to be difficult to diagnose. This study aimed to better understand this phenomenon and provide additional insight and key characteristics for both flight physicians and hyperbaric physicians. As human exploration continues to challenge the limits of sustainable physiology, the incidence of aerospace DCS may increase and underscores our need to recognize and appropriately treat it. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.","aviation; decompression sickness; high-performance aircraft; hyperbaric","Aerospace Medicine; Altitude; Altitude Sickness; Aviation; Decompression; Decompression Sickness; Humans; Hyperbaric Oxygenation; Retrospective Studies; adverse event; aerospace medicine; altitude; altitude disease; aviation; decompression; decompression sickness; education; human; hyperbaric oxygen therapy; retrospective study","","","","","","","Auten JD, Kuhne MA, Walker HM, Porter HO., Neurologic decompression sickness following cabin pressure fluctuations at high altitude, Aviat Space Environ Med, 81, 4, pp. 427-430, (2010); Barratt MR, Pool SL., Principles of clinical medicine for space flight, (2008); Bendrick GA, Ainscough MJ, Pilmanis AA, Bisson RU., Prevalence of decompression sickness among U-2 pilots, Aviat Space Environ Med, 67, 3, pp. 199-206, (1996); Bennett PB, Brubakk AO, Neuman TS, Elliott DH., Bennett and Elliott’s physiology and medicine of diving, (2003); Boycott AE, Damant GC, Haldane JS., The prevention of compressed-air illness, J Hyg (Lond), 8, 3, pp. 342-443, (1908); Butler WP, Topper SM, Dart TS., USAF treatment table 8: treatment for altitude decompression sickness, Aviat Space Environ Med, 73, 1, pp. 46-49, (2002); Conkin J, Gernhardt ML, Abercromby AF, Feiveson AH., Probability of hypobaric decompression sickness including extreme exposures, Aviat Space Environ Med, 84, 7, pp. 661-668, (2013); Dart TS, Butler W., Towards new paradigms for the treatment of hypobaric decompression sickness, Aviat Space Environ Med, 69, 4, pp. 403-409, (1998); Davis JC, Sheffield PJ, Schuknecht L, Heimbach RD, Dunn JM, Et al., Altitude decompression sickness: hyperbaric therapy results in 145 cases, Aviat Space Environ Med, 48, 8, pp. 722-730, (1977); Eckstein M., Navy clear on causes of physiological events in pilots, Final recommendations released for physiologic events mitigation, (2020); Fryer DI., Pathological findings in fatal sub-atmosphere decompression sickness, Med Sci Law, 2, 2, pp. 110-123, (1962); Gibbons JA, Ramsey CS, Wright JK, Pilmanis AA., Case history of serious altitude decompression sickness following rapid rate of ascent, Aviat Space Environ Med, 74, 6, pp. 675-678, (2003); Gribble MD., A comparison of the “high-altitude” and “high-pressure” syndromes of decompression sickness, Br J Ind Med, 17, pp. 181-186, (1960); Hudson L., Navy ‘not declaring victory’ on physiological episodes, Inside Defense, (2018); Kraft S., U.S. Navy Diving Manual, Rev. 7, 0910-LP-115-1921, (2016); Luft UC, Clamann HG, Adler HF., Alveolar gases in rapid decompression to high altitudes, J Appl Physiol, 2, 1, pp. 37-48, (1949); McGuire SA, Sherman PM, Brown AC, Robinson AY, Tate DF, Et al., 09 FHyperintense white matter lesions in 50 high-altitude pilots with neuro-edi logicAdecompression sickness, Aviat Space Environ Med, 83, 12, pp. 1117-1122, (2012); Mitchell SJ, Bennett MH, Moon RE., Decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism, N Engl J Med, 386, 13, pp. 1254-1264, (2022); Moon RE., Hyperbaric oxygen therapy indications, (2019); Moon RE, Sheffield PJ., Guidelines for treatment of decompression illness, Aviat Space Environ Med, 68, 3, pp. 234-243, (1997); Neubauer JC, Dixon JP, Herndon CM., Fatal pulmonary decompression sickness: a case report, Aviat Space Environ Med, 59, 12, pp. 1181-1184, (1988); Pilmanis AA, Petropoulos L, Kannan N, Evans F, Christodoulides N., Altitude Decompression Sickness Risk Assessment Computer (ADRAC) development, (1999); Thom SR, Bennett M, Banham ND, Chin W, Blake DF, Et al., Association of microparticles and neutrophil activation with decompression sickness, J Appl Physiol (1985), 119, 5, pp. 427-434, (2015); Van Liew HD, Flynn ET., Direct ascent from air and N2-O2 saturation dives in humans: DCS risk and evidence of a threshold, Undersea Hyperb Med, 32, 6, pp. 409-419, (2005); Vann RD, Butler FK, Mitchell SJ, Moon RE., Decompression illness, Lancet, 377, 9760, pp. 153-164, (2011); Webb JT., Documentation for the USAF School of Aerospace Medicine Altitude Decompression Sickness Research Database, (2010)","C.J.

As part of the programme development and design, the programme development team explored and then implemented progress testing into a strand of the programme. The objective of this educational perspective is to scrutinise the literature around the use of progress testing in higher education programmes, namely medicine, to explain how and why this decision was reached. Methods: The initial search strategy was developed using the electronic databases CINHAL Complete and SCOPUS. Key words included ‘progress test’ and ‘medicine’ or ‘health’ or ‘education’ or ‘higher education’. Eliminating articles that were not relevant, and also identifying and adding additional articles by key authors and experts resulted in thirty-three key articles being considered for review. Results: The thirty-three articles were a mixture of review articles, empirical research, case studies and conference presentations. Five key themes were identified which are discussed in this article; the evolution of progress testing; advantages of progress testing, disadvantages of progress testing, developing a test framework and academic progression and student feedback. Discussion: Progress testing is now well established in pre-registration medical programmes globally. The advantages of progress testing and the use of frequent look rapid remediation appear to be undisputed. Key disadvantages with progress testing were identified as it being an administrative heavy assessment process as well as a perceived bias towards male students undertaking this type of assessment. Conclusion: Now this assessment practice is established within medicine, it seems reasonable to explore its use in other areas of healthcare, such as radiography. © 2022","Assessment; Curriculum; Education; Medical Imaging; Progress Testing; Radiography","Curriculum; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Educational Status; Humans; Male; Radiography; Students; adult; curriculum; diagnostic imaging; education; empirical research; human; human experiment; male; medical education; radiography; review; Scopus; systematic review; tertiary education; educational status; medical education; radiography; student","","","","","","","(2021); Baird J., David Andrich D., Hopfenbeck T.N., Et al., Assessment and learning: fields apart?, Assess Educ: Principles, Policy Practice, 24, 3, pp. 317-350, (2017); Race P., The lecturer's toolkit: a practical guide to assessment, learning and teaching, (2013); Schuwirth L.W., Van der Vleuten C.P., Programmatic assessment: from assessment of learning to assessment for learning, Med Teach, 33, 6, pp. 478-485, (2011); Van Der Vleuten C.P.M., Verwijne G.M., Wijnen W.H.F.W., Fifteen years of experience with progress testing in a problem-based learning curriculum, Med Teach, 18, 2, pp. 103-109, (1996); Croy S., Development of a group work assessment pedagogy using constructive alignment theory, Nurse Educ Today, 61, pp. 49-53, (2018); Sambell K., Brown S., Race P., Assessment as a locus for engagement: priorities and practicalities, Italian J Educ Res, pp. 45-62, (2019); Senel S., Senel H., Remote assessment in higher education during COVID-19 pandemic, Int J Assess Tool Educ, 8, 2, pp. 181-199, (2021); Kolhatkar I.; Langer M.M., Swanson D.B., Practical considerations in equating progress tests, Med Teach, 32, 6, pp. 509-512, (2010); Wrigley W., van der Vleuten C.P., Freeman A., Et al., A systemic framework for the progress test: strengths, constraints and issues: AMEE Guide No. 71, Med Teach, 34, 9, pp. 683-697, (2012); Ali K., Coombes L., Kay E., Et al., Progress testing in undergraduate dental education: the Peninsula experience and future opportunities, Eur J Dent Educ, 20, 3, pp. 129-134, (2016); Rutgers D.R., van Raamt F., van Lankeren W., Et al., Fourteen years of progress testing in radiology residency training: experiences from The Netherlands, Eur Radiol, 28, 5, pp. 2208-2215, (2018); McHarg J., Bradley P., Chamberlain S., Et al., Assessment of progress tests, Med Educ, 39, 2, pp. 221-227, (2005); Albanese M., Case S.M., Progress testing: critical analysis and suggested practices, Adv Health Sci Educ Theory Pract, 21, 1, pp. 221-234, (2016); Swanson D.B., Holtzman K.Z., Butler A., Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine cumulative achievement testing study G.

Methods: A professional interest survey on the perceived value of a dual program with 222 registered nurses (RN) and registered dietitian nutritionists (RDN) and an in-depth literature review were completed. Results: A majority of RNs indicated the addition of the RDN would be beneficial for supporting patients with diet-related chronic diseases and performing nutritional assessments and interventions. The RDN respondents indicated a dual program approach would also improve the ability to serve a small community or place of employment that is limited in having both a full-time RDN and RN, and rated benefits for performing more medical and laboratory procedures. The RDNs also indicated the dual program could help increase their income potential. Both dual Master's and dual Bachelor's programs were rated as valuable. Of the 18 (8%) of respondents who had both RDN and RN credentials, half indicated personal growth and interest was the incentive for pursuing the dual training; whereas half indicated professional incentives (e.g., no RDN in the area, improving specialty care, job security, lack of opportunities), The literature review indicated no studies on the efficacy of a dual RDN-RN program on health outcomes; however, studies have shown that individualized counseling from RDNs is more beneficial than general nutritional counselling from other health care providers not specifically trained in dietary assessments. Noted barriers to pursuing dual training included time and cost, and some respondents in both specialties were not interested in a dual program. Discussion: These results support providing students with dual program options, although further exploration of the specific approach is warranted, particularly decreasing time-to-degree while not affecting efficacy. © 2021 The Author(s)","Dietetics; Education; Interdisciplinary; Interprofessional; Nursing; Nutritionist","Dietetics; Humans; Nurses; Nutrition Therapy; Nutritional Status; Nutritionists; Article; chronic disease; health; human; job security; nutrition; nutritional assessment; nutritional counseling; questionnaire; systematic review; training; diet therapy; dietetics; dietitian; education; nurse; nutritional status","","","","","Denton DeSotel","The authors thank the team at Hanover Research, specifically Bridget Brennan, PhD, Laura Bolling, and Denton DeSotel, for assisting in the design of the survey, as well as the independent conduct of the survey.","Meehan A., PartridgeJ, Jonnalagadda S.S., Clinical and economic value of nutrition in healthcare: a nurse's perspective, Nutr Clin Pract, 34, 6, pp. 832-838, (2019); Sharma K., Mogensen K.M., Robinson M.K., Pathophysiology of critical illness and role of nutrition, Nutr Clin Pract, 34, 1, pp. 12-22, (2019); Tappenden K.A., Quatrara B., Parkhurst M.L., Malone A.M., Fanjiang G., Ziegler T., Critical role of nutrition in improving quality of care: an interdisciplinary call to action to address adult hospital malnutrition, J Acad Nutr Diet, 113, pp. 1219-1237, (2013); Buttorff C., Ruder T., Bauman M., Multiple chronic Conditions in the United States, (2017); Jardim T.V., Mozaffarian D., Abrahams-Gessel S., Sy S., Lee Y., Liu J., Et al., Cardiometabolic disease costs associated with suboptimal diet in the United States: a cost analysis based on microsimulation model, PLoS Med, 16, 12, (2019); Dean E., Skinner M., Peng-Ming H., Jones A.Y.M., Gosselink R., Soderlund A., Why COVID-19 strengthens the case to scale up assault on non-communicable diseases: role of health professionals including physical therapists in mitigating pandemic waves, AIMS Publ Health, 8, 2, pp. 369-375, (2021); Academy of nutrition and dietetics: revised 2017 scope of practice for the registered dietitian nutritionist, J Acad Nutr Diet, 118, pp. 141-165, (2018); Academy of nutrition and dietetics: revised 2017 scope of practice for the nutrition and dietetics technician, registered, J Acad Nutr Diet, 118, pp. 327-342, (2018); Mitchell H., Lucas C., Charlton K., McMahon A., Models of nutrition-focused continuing education programs for nurses: a systematic review of the evidence, Aust J Prim Health, 24, pp. 101-108, (2018); Vasiloglou M.F., Fletcher J., Poulia K.A., Challenges and perspectives in nutritional counselling and nursing: a narrative review, J Clin Med, 8, pp. 1489-1499, (2019); DiMaria-Ghalili R.A., Mirtallo J.M., Tobin B.W., Hark L., van Horn L., Palmer C.A., Challenges and opportunities for nutrition education and training in the health care professions: intraprofessional and interprofessional call to action, Am J Clin Nutr, 99, pp. 1184S-1193S, (2014); Kicklighter J.R., Dorner B., Hunter A.M., Kyle M., Prescott M.P., Roberts S., Et al., Visioning report 2017: a preferred path forward for the nutrition and dietetics profession, J Acad Nutr Diet, 117, 1, pp. 110-127, (2017); Interprofessional collaboration in education and practice.

The majority of these latter courses are instructor-led, with little student interaction. From a more contemporary perspective, it is critical to experiment with and learn from one’s own experiences in order to educate entrepreneurs. As a result, more innovative approaches to education are gradually emerging, including project-based, action-based, and apprenticeship-based learning. Several institutions have launched entrepreneurial apprenticeship-based learning programs in the last few years, primarily for management students. Due to Malaysia’s lack of structure and credit opportunities, entrepreneurial apprenticeships at public universities remain uncommon and thus under-researched. Thus, the contribution’s study topic is how program stakeholders can organize apprenticeship-based learning and the effect this has on graduates’ readiness to start their own businesses. Thus, the technique used in this study is to conduct a review of the current literature on entrepreneurial learning in order to gain a better understanding of the entrepreneurial apprenticeship-based learning component of the 2u2i program. Second, the case of an entrepreneurial apprenticeship program for graduates near University Malaysia Kelantan, a public university with a strong entrepreneurial cluster, is examined to gain insight into the impact of apprenticeship on entrepreneurship education in general and non-business subjects in particular. For this purpose, a case study was created based on interviews with graduates and mentors. Overall, the results will serve as a model for entrepreneurial education and training in a university setting, which will benefit those interested in developing entrepreneurship education course concepts. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Entrepreneurial apprenticeships based learning; Higher education","","","","","","","","Bell R., Bell H., Replicating the networking, mentoring and venture creation benefits of entrepreneurship centres on a shoestring: A student-centred approach to entrepreneurship education and venture creation, Ind.

The development has been running as a dual vocational education programme. It is realized in cooperation with Secondary Vocational School for Electrotechnics in Kosice, and since conception over 200 students went through a 3-year old curriculum. The programme is tailored for the secondary school graduates and in the context of Slovak education it is considered as a higher professional form of education. Formally, standing at ISCED level 3b it is, in principle, equivalent to university-based bachelor studies. While the dual programme is steadily delivering value to our business, we are exploring the ways to move the educational concept beyond merely dual secondary level. In the contribution we argue the needs, benefits and specific ways forward in improving the mutual permeability of vocational education system especially in vertical dimensions. We share our vision of efficiently interconnecting the dual VET level with the 'standard' tertiary education levels. Why does this matter? We believe it might (1) increase the attractiveness of VET as a path for personal development, and (2) open up paths to further education to the graduates of the dual form of higher studies.  © 2022 IEEE.","","Deutsche telekom; Education programmes; Education systems; IT solution; School graduates; Secondary schools; Skills development; Slovakia; Vocational education; Vocational schools; Apprentices","","","","","","","Dzbor M., Tapak J., Rabatin P., Hrusovsky T., From schoolcompany collaboration on educating students to a structured career development system, 15th International Conference on Emerging ELearning Technologies and Applications (ICETA), (2017); Tertiary Education Statistics Explained; Bohler J., Weigel F., Hall D., Educational Technology Gap Theory, 15th Americas Conference on Information Systems, (AMCIS), 771, (2009); Ferranti D., Perry G., Gill I., Et al., Closing the Gap in Education and Technology, World Bank Report, (2003); Papert S., Computer Criticism vs. Technocentric Thinking, Educational Researcher, 16, 1, (1987); Lizbetinova L., Motivácia študentov k volbe študovat na vysokej škole, Mladá Veda, (2017); Orndorff R.M., Herr E.L., A comparative study of declared and undeclared college students on career uncertainity and involvement in career development activities, J. of Counseling and Development, 74, pp. 632-639, (1996); Dziuban C.D., Tango R.A., Hynes M., An assessment of effect of vocational exploration on career decision making, Journal of Employment Counseling, 31, pp. 127-136, (1994); Esser F.H., Permeability As the Key to An Education System That Meets Future Needs, 4, (2014); Hartmann E.A., Knust M., Loroff C., Stamm-Riemer I., Towards Permeability between Vocational and Academic Education.

Conceptually, the article layers an articulation of decolonising education onto apprenticeship learning in such a way as to explicitly support apprentices’ prior knowledge and recognise the socio-political context within which apprenticeship learning occurs. Empirically, the article draws on qualitative in-depth interviews with Indigenous carpentry apprentices about their experiences with on-the-job training in order to better understand how Indigenous adult learners negotiate well-documented systemic barriers to education and employment. By contrasting participants’ experiences in industry worksites to their experiences with Indigenous-centric curriculum offered by the Manitoba-based social enterprise BUILD, the article develops a discussion of how market-driven apprenticeship programmes limit the potential achievements of Indigenous learners and how a decolonising approach to apprenticeship learning that prioritises Indigenous epistemologies may result in higher levels of learner success. © 2020 The Vocational Aspect of Education Ltd.","apprenticeship learning;

Little is known about the interrelation between educational aspirations and institutionally co-structured educational pathways. These interrelations are particularly important in an early tracking and a highly segregated education system like Switzerland, where–in contrast to many other countries–vocational education and training is highly valued and frequently attended. We evaluate how educational aspirations amongst young adults of the second generation and Swiss natives change as young people move through the education system–and thus through different educational contexts.

In recent years, apprenticeship programs are being implemented to train young people to address shortage of skills workers and ageing workforce problem. This study aims to understand the factors influencing career decisions among apprentices in the construction sector. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative research approach was used to address the objectives of the study. Forty semi-structured interviews were conducted to gain insights into the reason why young people decide to participate in construction craftsperson apprenticeship in Nigeria. Findings: The study reveals that “interest and passion”, “role model”, “macroeconomic environment and government policies”, “spirit of entrepreneurship”, “formal, informal and non-formal education” and “family socioeconomic status” are the factors influencing career decisions among construction craftspeople. Originality/value: The study provides fresh insights that can be used to develop strategies for attracting and increasing the number of young people that sign up for construction craftspeople apprenticeships. The apprentice training programmes are essential for addressing labour shortage, which is one of the factors affecting the performance of construction projects. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Apprenticeship; Career choice; Construction industry; Craftsperson; Nigeria; Workforce","Apprentices; Behavioral research; Decision making; Apprenticeship; Apprenticeship programs; Career choice; Career decision makings; Construction projects; Craftsperson; Nigeria; Workers'; Workforce; Young peoples; Construction industry","","","","","","","Abdul-Aziz S.N., Zulkifli N., Nashir I.M., Abdul-Karim N.A., Pull and Push factors of students’ enrolment in the TVET programme at community colleges in Malaysia, Journal of Technical Education and Training, 12, 1, pp. 68-75, (2020); Acharya N.K., Dai-Lee Y., Im H.M., Conflicting factors in construction projects: Korean perspective, Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management, 13, 6, pp. 543-566, (2006); Ackah-Baidoo P., Youth unemployment in resource-rich Sub-Saharan Africa: a critical review, The Extractive Industries and Society, 3, 1, pp. 249-261, (2016); Aje O.I., Olatunji O.A., Olalusi O.A., Overrun causations under advance payment regimes, Built Environment Project and Asset Management, 7, 1, pp. 86-98, (2017); Alarape A., On the road to institutionalising entrepreneurship education in Nigeria universities, International Journal of Management Education, 7, 2, pp. 81-87, (2008); Asiyanbola O.D., Construction Craftsmen's Availability and Project Performance in Selected Southwestern States, Nigeria, (2018); Awe E.M., A Framework for Training and Development of Construction Craft Skills in Nigeria, (2017); Awe E.M., Griffith A., Stephenson P., Identifying and tackling problems militating against youth interest in construction crafts careers: panacea for effective PPP implementation in Nigeria, Public Private Partnerships, a Proceeding of CIB TG72/ARCOM Doctoral Research Workshop, (2011); Babbie E., The Basics of Social Research, (2011); Barraket J., Loosemore M., Co-creating social value through cross-sector collaboration between social enterprises and the construction industry, Construction Management and Economic, 36, 7, pp. 394-408, (2018); Bilau A.A., Ajagbe M.A., Kigbu H.H., Sholanke A.B., Review of shortage of skilled craftsmen in small and medium construction firms in Nigeria, Journal of Environment and Earth Science, 5, 15, pp. 98-110, (2015); Broussard S.C., Garrison M.E.B., The relationship between classroom motivation and academic achievement in elementary school-aged children, Family and Consumer Sciences Research Journal, 33, 2, pp. 106-120, (2004); Bryman A., Social Research Methods, (2012); Buschor B.C., Berweger S., KeckFrei A., Kappler C., Majoring in STEM–what accounts for women's career decision making?

However, Dual VET still coexists with traditional VET. The former has much more on-the-job training, companies are more involved in curricula design and training management, and trainees receive a salary or a scholarship. This study analysed the effect of Dual VET on students’ grades and degree completion. We use the whole population of Catalan students during four academic years (from 2015–2016 to 2018–2019) that completed their degree. We employ an instrumental variable approach to explain grades at completion. Results show that Dual VET had a positive effect on grades irrespective of the method and outcome used (standardised or non-standardised grades). In fact, our instrumental variables estimation showed a greater impact than the ordinary least squares results. In addition, Dual VET also increased the probability of graduation. Thus, the transformation of the Catalan VET into a Dual VET may have positive effects, since the latter improves course completion and grades. © 2022 The Author(s).

This is occurring since the talents or skills required by the sector differ from those accessible on the demand Hence, developing nations require practical VET systems and dual systems. Indonesia has recently attempted to examine the Dual Vocational Education and Training system in greater detail. This study investigates the challenges encountered by Indonesia throughout the implementation of its dual VET system and how they overcame them to ensure effective delivery. Notably, the primary goal of this literature study was to provide theoretically announced and policy-relevant understandings of the obstacles or challenges that every nation would encounter while establishing a dual system. This study combines empirical survey results from Germany and Switzerland to identify significant challenges and critical success criteria for the transfer. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) were used to guide the conduct of a systematic review. The results show that the direct transfer or implementing present multiple challenges and difficulties that comprise Challenges for The Public Sector and The Public-Private. On the other hand, for a successful transfer of VET tight cooperation between all stakeholders and a shared awareness and deeper knowledge of the contextual conditions in the target nation are paramount. Therefore, the question of whether the dual VET system in German or Switzerland can be directly implemented in another country, without first examining specific challenges and difficulties of each context, must be clearly and systematically considered. © Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Publisher’s Office.","Dual VET system; success factor; training system; TVET","","","","","","","","Adams R.

Among others, it can function as a buffer against economic downturns that come along with inferior employment and education opportunities, especially for young adults. However, cross-country mobility of young adults in Europe remains low, as language barriers, the loss of social ties or cultural differences create obstacles for migration. Against this background, Germany has launched a mobility assistance programme that supports young adults from EU member states who wish to enter the dual education system in Germany. To assess the causal impact of this programme, we compare migration flows to Germany from participating and non-participating countries in a difference-in-differences framework. Our results reveal a substantial programme effect that is larger for countries with above-average youth unemployment rates.

In particular, we examine how the degree of vocational specificity of VET programmes affects occupational status mobility throughout individuals’ early careers, a topic that has hitherto received little attention. We adopt a life course perspective and combine an individual-level theoretical approach (human capital and signalling theory) with an institutional approach. The former focuses on individuals’ skill acquisition during VET and across the early career. The latter emphasises that individuals’ allocation to a training programme influences the amount and types of skills they acquire. The multinomial logistic regression analyses are based on a combination of detailed curricula-based occupation-level data on the specificity of training programmes and individual-level data from the Transitions From Education to Employment (TREE) longitudinal dataset. The results show, firstly, that labour market allocation at the beginning of a career has consequences for later labour market outcomes. Second, practical occupation-specific education and training facilitate status stability at labour market entry, while general skills and knowledge are decisive for long-term upward mobility. © 2022 by the author(s); licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","dual training; general knowledge; occupation-specific skills; returns to education; vertical mobility; vocational education and training","","","","","","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF, (100017_156204)","We would like to thank Christian Imdorf, Kathrin Leuze, and the three anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.

The reduction of youth unemployment, in particular, is considered as a central motive. Similarly, some promoting factors and challenges that influence the transfer of vocational education are already known. The focus of this study is on the reform of the Mexican vocational education system and the facilitating and inhibiting factors faced by the different actors from German-speaking countries involved. The study is based on 22 expert interviews that were analysed using qualitative content analysis. The results show that there are factors that have both a positive and a negative impact on transfer in Mexico. © 2022 The Authors.

This paper aims to study the implementation of dual VET in Spain, focusing on the working conditions of company tutors in the tourism sector of Andalusia and the Canary Islands. Approach: Dual VET has been implemented in different ways, both between the different autonomous regions and professional areas since it was launched in 2012. In order to analyse these differences, interviews with teachers, head teachers, students and company tutors were carried out, between 2020 and 2021, in centres that had implemented dual vocational education training and centres that had not. The educational programme in dual VET implies a closer collaboration between schools and companies, as both are active training areas; the training objectives are shared between the school and the company. In this study, the company tutor is studied in his or her facet as trainer and assessor; but special emphasis is placed on the characteristics of the tourism sector, given its relevance in understanding the educational processes involved. Three dimensions underpin the analysis: the characteristics of the company tutor, the training and assessment processes implemented and the link that both maintain with the dynamics of tourism companies. Findings: In general terms, the initial assumptions put forward are confirmed. Firstly, the educational centre leads the process, taking the initiative yet without having the conditions of governance and negotiation typical of the Germanic countries from which these vocational education training systems originate. Secondly, the main characteristics of the company tutor are heterogeneity and informality. Thirdly, the contents and methodology are conditioned by the characteristics of the tourism sector. And finally, assessment also follows informal and changing procedures, generating tensions between the educational centre and company. Conclusions: These results give rise to some theoretical reflections. If the education system is an institution based on the principle of equality, it is worth asking to what extent dual VET can alter this principle, as the company adapts some of the contents and learning outcomes to its specific needs. In addition, an important differentiating factor that marks the learning dynamics has been detected: the size of the company. The difference in size may also influence the future prospects of trainees joining the workforce after completion of VET studies. © 2023 European Research Network Vocational Education and Training.

This paper examines whether updates of education curricula help to bring new technologies faster into firms’ workplaces. We study technology changes and curriculum updates from an early wave of digitalization (i.e., computer-numerically controlled machinery, computer-aided design, and desktop publishing software). We take a text-as-data approach and tap into two novel data sources to measure change in educational content and the use of technology at the workplace: first, vocational education curricula and, second, firms’ job advertisements. To examine the causal effects of adding new technology skills to curricula on the diffusion of these technologies in firms’ workplaces (measured by job advertisements), we use an event study design. Our results show that curriculum updates substantially shorten the time it takes for new technologies to arrive in firms’ workplaces, especially for mainstream firms. © 2022, The Author(s).","Education curricula; Innovation policy; SMEs; Technology adoption; Technology diffusion; Text as data","Apprentices; Computer aided design; Desktop publishing; E-learning; Engineering education; Machine design; Machinery; Taps; Education curriculums; Innovation policies; SME; Switzerland; Technological change; Technology adoption; Technology diffusion; Text as data; Training curriculum; Vocational education and training; Curricula","","","","","Staatssekretariat für Bildung, Forschung und Innovation, SBFI","We are grateful to Simone Balestra, Eric Bettinger, Alex Bryson, David Dorn, David Figlio, Dietmar Harhoff, Simon Janssen, Edward Lazear, and Jens Mohrenweiser for their valuable comments and suggestions.

However, young people's learning experiences of these programmes, and how these shape their early formative experiences in the labour market is underexplored. We address this gap by presenting new analysis of an extensive qualitative dataset, involving interviews with participants in Greece's Continuous Vocational Training (CVET) Program. Drawing on Unwin and Fuller's influential theory of restrictive and expansive learning environments which was developed through examination of formal apprenticeship programmes, we explore the extent to which these short-term vocational training programs provide meaningful learning and work experiences for young people. We show that vocational training facilitated through ALMPs is often experienced as restrictive, underpinned by a lack of meaningful training, occupation-specific skills, supportive guidance and quality employment prospects. Furthermore, we show how ALMPs in such contexts not only fail to support young people, but they also reinforce and legitimize precarious work practices by socializing the younger generation of workers into low-pay, temporary and routine jobs. © 2022 The Authors.

The youth unemployment rate reached almost 60% during the crisis and those in employment were concentrated in temporary and low‐paid jobs (Papadopoulos, 2016 ). With the reform of Vocational Education System in 2011 and the introduction of ‘innovative’ practices like the Training Vouchers there was an anticipation that training programmes would equip low‐skilled young people with skills and human capital necessary to navigate a challenging labour market (Cedefop, 2018). Training Vouchers are part of the Europe 2020 Strategy and the initiative that are funded by the Youth Guarantee Scheme. Responding to previous criticisms of the VET, Training Subsidies were supposed to reduce bureaucracy, provide higher transparency and quality and more crucially give trainees the freedom to choose for themselves the Training Provider (Nteli, 2015 ). Although they have been implemented in several industries, hospitality and tourism sectors were identified as the most dynamic and fast‐growing sectors so investing in young people's skills and qualification in this sector became a policy priority (Cedefop, 2018).

While makerspace education has the potential to democratize educational spaces, the integration of these new technologies into the classroom is not trivial. In this paper, we analyze a university-based makerspace apprenticeship program for pre-service teachers to learn makerspace tools and technologies for use in their future classrooms. We demonstrate how apprenticeship in this community of practice led to increased confidence in maker tools and technologies and a mindset toward learning in makerspaces as playful, collaborative, and iterative. We found that pre-service teachers require greater opportunities to see students engaged in making in elementary classrooms. We end with recommendations for supporting pre-service teachers to adopt making for their future classrooms. © 2022, Association for Educational Communications & Technology.","Elementary education; Maker education; Pre-service teacher education","","","","","","","","Calabrese Barton A., Tan E., A longitudinal study of equity-oriented STEM-rich making among youth from historically marginalized communities, American Educational Research Journal, 55, 4, pp. 761-800, (2018); Cobb P., Confrey J., DiSessa A., Lehrer R., Schauble L., Design experiments in educational research, Educational Researcher, 32, 1, pp. 9-13, (2003); Cohen J., Maker principles and technologies in teacher education: A national survey, Journal of Technology and Teacher Education, 25, 1, pp. 5-30, (2017); Cohen J.D., Huprich J., Jones W.M., Smith S., Educators’ perceptions of a maker-based learning experience, (2017); Cohen J.D., Jones W.M., Smith S., Preservice and early career teachers' preconceptions and misconceptions about making in education, Journal of Digital Learning in Teacher Education, 34, 1, pp. 31-42, (2018); Darling-Hammond L., Teacher education and the American future, Journal of Teacher Education, 61, 1-2, pp. 35-47, (2010); Dougherty D., The maker mindset, Design, make, play: Growing the next generation of STEM innovators, pp. 7-11, (2013); Halverson E.R., Sheridan K., The maker movement in education, Harvard Educational Review, 84, 4, pp. 495-504, (2014); Honey M., Kanter D.E., Design, make, play: Growing the next generation of STEM innovators, (2013); Jones W.M., Smith S., Cohen J., Preservice teachers' beliefs about using maker activities in formal K-12 educational settings: A multi-institutional study, Journal of Research on Technology in Education, 49, 3-4, pp. 134-148, (2017); Jones W.M., Cohen J.D., Schad M., Caratachea M., Smith S., Maker-centered teacher professional development: Examining K-12 teachers’ learning experiences in a commercial makerspace, TechTrends, 64, 1, pp. 37-49, (2020); Lave J., Wenger E., Situated learning: Legitimate peripheral participation, (1991); Lindstrom D., Thompson A.D., Schmidt-Crawford D.A., The maker movement: Democratizing STEM education and empowering learners to shape their world, Journal of Digital Learning in Teacher Education, 33, 3, pp. 89-90, (2017); Martin L., The promise of the maker movement for education, Journal of Pre-College Engineering Education Research, 5, 1, (2015); Millen D.R., Rapid ethnography: Time deepening strategies for HCI field research, In Proceedings of the 3Rd Conference on Designing Interactive Systems: Processes, Practices, Methods, and Techniques, pp. 280-286, (2000); Miles M.B., Huberman A.M., Qualitative data analysis: An expanded sourcebook, (1994); O'brien S., Hansen A.K., Harlow D.B., Educating teachers for the maker movement: Pre-service teachers' experiences facilitating maker activities, In Proceedings of the 6Th Annual Conference on Creativity and Fabrication in Education, pp. 99-102, (2016); Peppler K., Bender S., Maker movement spreads innovation one project at a time, Phi Delta Kappan, 95, 3, pp. 22-27, (2013); Resnick M., Rosenbaum E., Designing for tinkerability, Design, make, play: Growing the next generation of STEM innovators, pp. 163-181, (2013); Rodriguez S.R., Harron J.R., DeGraff M.W., UTeach maker: A micro-credentialing program for preservice teachers, Journal of Digital Learning in Teacher Education, 34, 1, pp. 6-17, (2018); Sheridan K., Halverson E.R., Litts B., Brahms L., Jacobs-Priebe L., Owens T., Learning in the making: A comparative case study of three makerspaces, Harvard Educational Review, 84, 4, pp. 505-531, (2014); Shively K., Hitchens C., Hitchens N., Teaching severe weather: Examining teacher candidates’ early field experience in a makerspace environment, Journal of Education, (2020); Stevenson M., Bower M., Falloon G., Forbes A., Hatzigianni M., By design: Professional learning ecologies to develop primary school teachers’ makerspaces pedagogical capabilities, British Journal of Educational Technology, 50, 3, pp. 1260-1274, (2019); Thomas A., Making makers: Kids, tools, and the future of innovation, (2014); Vygotsky L.S., Play and its role in the mental development of the child, Soviet Psychology, 5, 3, pp. 6-18, (1967); Zosh J.M., Fisher K., Golinkoff R.M., Hirsh-Pasek K., The ultimate block party: Bridging the science oflearning and the importance of play, Design, make, play: Growing the next generation of STEM innovators, pp. 95-118, (2013)","S.C.

Despite these significant investments, companies failed to invest equally in training and upskilling to operate and maintain their equipment. Instead, companies looked to hiring the skilled employees necessary to perform these duties. Unfortunately, this human capital strategy has not gone according to plan because companies struggle to find the qualified employees required to support their operations. Although employer-sponsored internship and co-op programs are heavily utilized as a recruitment tool, they fail to provide meaningful training and often fail to meet the employer’s needs to plug the talent shortfall. Apprenticeships offer a viable way for companies to address the human capital shortfall. There are several apprenticeship models that an employer may select to implement. Not only apprenticeship programs offer employers a positive return on investment, but also the program is a viable human capital strategy a company can employ to create a highly skilled talent pipeline. Moreover, apprenticeships are a retention tool, with 89% of the apprentices remaining with the company’s 3-year postapprenticeship program graduation. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Alternative education and training; Apprentice; Apprenticeship; Earn and learn; High-demand Job; Human capital strategies; Occupation; On-the-job training; Return-on-investment; ROI; Skilled workforce; Skills gap; Workforce strategy","","","","","","","","Collins M., Why Automation Needs Apprenticeships: American companies rushed to invest in automation, but not the training needed to operate,maintain, troubleshoot and repair the equipment, (2018); Golden R., In the race to respond to automation, apprenticeships may lead the way, (2017); Lerman R.I., Scaling apprenticeship to increase human capital in part 1: Developing human capital for the modern, Global Economy, (2019); Kuehn D., Hacker I., Simon A., Registered apprenticeship ion science and engineering, (2019); Internships and co-ops: What’s the difference?; What is an internship?; Lerman R., Eyster L., Chambers K., The Benefits and challenges of registered apprenticeships: The sponsor’s perspective, (2009); The benefits and cost of apprenticeships: A business perspective, (2016); U.S. Department of Labor Research and Statistics; Muehlemann S., Wolter S.C., Return on investment of apprenticeship systems for enterprises: Evidence from cost-benefit analyses, IZA J.

The multilayered and fragmented nature of the German cooperation landscape suggests that German efforts in this area follow a complex and evolving interplay of motivations—yet the rationales behind Germany's bilateral work in the area of technical and vocational education and training (TVET) have rarely been examined in a systematic way. Additionally, existing approaches to the question of aid motivations as provided by economics and international relations scholarship appear to be ill-suited to understanding the rationales behind Germany's TVET cooperation efforts. Drawing on a combination of document analysis and interviews with key stakeholders, this paper investigates the heterogeneity of drivers and motivations behind German cooperation efforts in the promotion and export of the dual training model and examines the coordination challenges posed by this diversity. The paper finds that German efforts in the international promotion of dual training are driven by at least three analytically distinct rationales that correspond roughly to three differentiated poles within the German policy space—namely, the economic, development and education arenas. The paper also finds that this diversity of motivations poses important coordination challenges—and that, while recent coordination efforts have succeeded in securing some degree of rhetorical consistency, only limited progress has been made in terms of operational coherence. © 2022 The Authors.

Even though the transition to a largely digitalized and automated construction industry might be distant, it is important for construction professionals to understand the possible effect of these changes to the workforce. To this point, the present study provides an initial understanding of how job-readiness, pre-apprenticeship and apprenticeship programs within a midwestern state of the United States include digital literacy skills and construction-specific technology in their curricula using a survey approach. Our initial findings represent the responses from three programs and suggest that little hands-on activities using new technology are included in the curricula, and the students from these programs found learning about technology only slightly useful. Complementing our findings with information from other trades programs in the United States, we also note the importance of partnering with construction companies and technology manufacturers to advance technology training in trades education. Further research recommendations include gathering more participant input using alternate approaches, given our low response rate; understanding the role of technology companies and manufacturers in the training of construction trades workers; and surveying construction undergraduate programs about their efforts in preparing their students to handle human capital through as construction transitions to its 4.0 version. © 2022 IEEE.","Construction 4.0; Construction Engineering; Digital Literacy; Lifelong Learning; Workforce Training","Apprentices; Commerce; Construction industry; E-learning; Engineering education; Students; Automated construction; Construction 4.0; Construction engineering; Construction workforces; Development programmes; Digital literacies; Emerging technologies; Life long learning; Workforce development; Workforce training; Curricula","","","","","","","Occupational employment projections to 2022; 2020 Workforce Survey Results, (2020); De Soto B.G., Agusti-Juan I., Joss S., Hunhevicz J., Implications of Construction 4.0 to the workforce and organizational structures, International Journal of Construction Management, pp. 1-13, (2019); Carson K., Digitalization & Automation in the Constructions Trades 2020; Kim S., Moore A., Srinivasan D., Akanmu A., Barr A., Harris-Adamson C., Nussbaum M.A., Potential of exoskeleton technologies to enhance safety, health, and performance in construction: Industry perspectives and future research directions, IISE Transactions on Occupational Ergonomics and Human Factors, 7, 3-4, pp. 185-191, (2019); Cao Q., Wang, H Research on Digital Transformation of Construction Industry, ICCREM 2021, pp. 398-405, (2021); Arora N., Batra G., Santhanam N., Varanasi S., Teulieres M., Wong T., Construction and Building Technology-poised for a breakthroughMcKinsey & Company, (2020); Ho P.H., Labour and skill shortages in Hong Kong's construction industry, Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management, (2016); Construction Spending and Employment: History and Forecast Terms and Sources(webpage), (2021); Laal M., Salamati P., Lifelong learning; why do we need it, Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 31, pp. 399-403, (2012); Dickinson J.K., Woodard P., Canas R., Ahamed S., Lockston D., Game-based trench safety education: Development and lessons learned, Journal of Information Technology in Construction (ITcon), 16, 8, pp. 119-134, (2011); pp. 2021-2022; (2020); Clevenger C.M., Abdallah M., Wu W., Advisory board feedback on construction education learning outcomes, Proceedings of the Associated Schools of Construction 53rd Annual International Conference, (2017); Lee N., Ponton R., Jeffreys A.W., Cohn R., Analysis of industry trends for improving undergraduate curriculum in construction management education, ASC Proceedings of the 47th Annual International Conference, Omaha, NE, (2011); Emmer M.J., Ghanem A.A., Influence of Industry Advisory Boards on Construction Management Programs' Curriculum and Content, Proceedings of 49th ASC Annual International Conference, 13, (2013); Aileen C., Construction Unions Warming Up to Virtual Reality Training (webpage), (2018); Built Robotics Partners with Union for Robotics Training (webpage), (2020); Simulating Reality: Apprentice Training Moves Into Virtual Realm, Takes Notice of TV Show (webpage), (2016); Carpenters Union Incorporates Virtual Reality Welding (webpage), (2013); Kobayashi K., Ishigame S., Kato H., Skill training system of manual arc welding, Entertainment Computing, pp. 389-396, (2003); Chan V.S., Haron H.N.H., Isham M.I.B.M., Mohamed F.B., VR and AR virtual welding for psychomotor skills: A systematic review, Multimedia Tools and Applications, pp. 1-35, (2022); Adepoju O., Reskilling for Construction 4.0.

Our research aims to explore the impact of student employment on persistence and academic performance in STEM fields. During our research, we used the data of the Hungarian subsample of the PERSIST 2019 database (N=1045). According to our results, IT trainings are more resistant to the negative effects of employment than other trainings, as students working in this field did not differ from their non-employed peers in terms of either persistence or academic progress. Concerning the science, engineering, and non-STEM training, employment had a significant negative effect on academic performance, but it was primarily compensated by being employed in study-related jobs in science training, which also had a favorable effect in non-STEM training courses. However, in the field of engineering, employment in the profession reinforced this adverse effect too. In the field of informatics, study-related work also had a negative impact. Based on our results, we think it is worth considering the broader spread of dual training courses in higher education, during which students can complete an internship at a company or partner organization in addition to theoretical training. © 2022 International Journal of Education in Mathematics, Science and Technology.

However, research focusing on pupils’ and students’ readiness to participate in learning in the workplace is scarce and scattered. The present study was conducted to get a deeper insight into readiness to participate in learning in the workplace, and more particular in the Flemish (Belgium) context of dual education. The study applied a multi-method approach including literature review, document study, semi-structured interviews and member checking. The study resulted in a conceptualisation of ‘willingness to participate in learning in the workplace’ and ‘maturity for learning in the workplace’ including clusters of competencies related to participation in the workplace, learning in the workplace, and motivation for learning and participating in the workplace. This conceptualisation contributes to the development of policy and practice through providing a basis for assessing readiness to participate in dual education. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Dual learning; Learning in the workplace; Readiness for dual learning; Vocational education and training","","","","","","","","Bandura A., Self-efficacy: The exercise of control, (1997); Billett S., Workplace affordances and individual engagement at work, Journal of Workplace Learning, 13, 5, pp. 209-214, (2001); Brockmann M., Clarke L., Winch C., Knowledge, skills, competence: European divergences in vocational education and training (VET) – The English, German and Dutch cases, Oxford Review of Education, 34, 5, pp. 547-567, (2008); Brophy J., Goal theory, Motivating students to learn, pp. 87-118, (2004); Burrus K., Naemi B., Roberts R., Building better students: Preparation for the workforce, (2017); Caballero C., Walker A., Work readiness in graduate recruitment and selection: A review of current assessment methods, Journal of Teaching and Learning for Graduate Employability, 1, pp. 13-25, (2010); Cohen L., Manion L., Morrison K., Research methods in education, (2011); Crevits H., Muyters P., Nota aan de Vlaamse regering: Duaal leren een volwaardige kwalificerende leerweg, (2015); Deissinger T., The German dual vocational education and training system as good practice?, Local Economy, 30, 5, pp. 557-567, (2015); Deissinger T., Gonon P., The development and cultural foundations of dual apprenticeships – A comparison of Germany and Switzerland, Journal of Vocational Education & Training, 73, 2, pp. 197-216, (2021); Drollinger T., Comer L., Warrington P., Development and validation of the active empathetic listening scale, Psychology and Marketing, 23, pp. 161-180, (2006); Eiriksdottir E., Program coherence and integration of school- and work-based learning in the Icelandic dual vocational education and training (VET) system, Education in Science, 10, (2020); Ellstrom P., Integrating learning and work: Problems and prospects, Human Resource Development Quarterly, 12, 1, pp. 421-435, (2001); Eraut M., Non-formal learning and tacit knowledge in professional work, British Journal of Educational Psychology, 70, 1, pp. 113-136, (2000); Ferm L., Persson Thunqvist D., Svensson L., Gustavsson M., Students’ strategies for learning identities as industrial workers in a Swedish upper secondary school VET programme, Journal of Vocational Education & Training, 70, 1, pp. 66-84, (2018); Flanagan J., The critical incident technique, Psychological Bulletin, 51, 4, pp. 327-358, (1954); Gist M., Mitchell T., Self-efficacy: A theoretical analysis of its determinants and malleability, The Academy of Management Review, 17, 2, pp. 183-211, (1992); Gross R., Psychology: The science of mind and behaviour, (2010); Harackiewicz J., Barron K., Pintrich P., Elliot A., Trash T., Revision of achievement goal theory: Necessary and illuminating, Journal of Educational Psychology, 94, 3, pp. 638-645, (2002); Ilmarinen J., Tuomi K., Work ability of aging workers, Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment & Health, 18, 2, pp. 8-10, (1992); Kyndt E., Janssens I., Coertjens L., Gijbels D., Donche V., Van Petegem P., Vocational education students’ generic working life competencies: Developing a self-assessment instrument, Vocations and Learning, 7, pp. 365-392, (2013); Kyndt E., Endedijk M., Beausaert S., Werkplekleren faciliteren: De rol van de organisatie.

From the answers related to decision-making on accepting the dual model of education in their companies, the respondents showed a positive attitude in the percentage ranging from 56.66% to 73.33%. A lower percentage of eligibility indicates that respondents will not make an immediate decision without additional information.

This contribution aims to gain a better understanding of the health issues associated with apprentices’ experience in the Swiss dual vocational education and training system. It refers to two qualitative research projects: one concerns apprentices who have interrupted their training prematurely; the other relates to on-the-job trainers and their role in the occupational socialization of apprentices. The first project shows that physical and mental sufferings arise when apprentices are confronted with the realities of an occupation and the world of work. The second highlights the fact that trainers mainly address health and safety issues in terms of preventing any accident or damage to the physical health of apprentices. These elements highlight how health issues are part of the socialization to an occupation and the world of work, but often tacitly, which can be a source of pain. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Apprentices’ health; Dual vocational education and training; Premature termination of apprenticeship contract; Socialization; Suffering","Health; Apprenticeship contracts; Apprentice’ health; Dual vocational education and training; Health issues; Premature termination; Premature termination of apprenticeship contract; Specific works; Suffering; Switzerland; Vocational education and training; accident; accident prevention; adult; allergy; apprenticeship; Article; automutilation; backache; conflict; eating disorder; female; human; hygiene; longitudinal study; male; mental stress; occupational health; occupational safety; physical activity; posttraumatic stress disorder; qualitative research; sadness; sleep disorder; socialization; Switzerland; tension; vocational education; work environment; work schedule; Apprentices","","","","","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF, (100017_153323)","The project concerning the on-the-job trainers (""Vocational education and training trainers, key persons in the professional socialisation process"") was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) between 2014 and 2018 (No. 100017_153323).","Bardin L., L'analyse de contenu, (1986); Breslin F.C., Day D., Tompa E., Irvin E., Bhattacharyya S., Clarke J., Koehoorn M., Systematic review of factors associated with occupational disease among young people, (2006); Cart B., Toutin-Trelcat M.-H., Henguelle V., Apprenticeship contracts: why they are breached, Training Employment, 89, (2010); Chatigny C., Balleux A., Martin M., Grenier J., Étude exploratoire des dynamiques de formation et d'apprentissage.

In the light of globalization, it is also important to discuss the possibilities and pressures of meet i ng emergi ng demands f r om changi ng economies and modern technologies.” Management and innovation students who want to be practitioners require not only soft skills but analytical and datum, to achieve the organization's objectives. The Indian manufacturing sector is revered globally and is one of India's most successful industries. It has made a significant contribution to India's capital formation and hence GDP. Over the years, global expertise and enabling sale situations have ensured that India continues to be one of the wo r l d ' s mo s t c o mme r c i a l h e a l t h c a r e a n d manufacturing markets. The job process has seen a notable shift; technology affects customs and skills, and communities are becoming more global and diverse. As an effect of globalization, education systems are now also looking at the employability market. Apart from technical skills, applicants are also expected to have interpersonal skills in the current scenario. The study aimed to determine final-year engineering learners' perspectives, faculty-approved by engineering colleges and technical specialists from various professional bodies on training needs, career progression, and career apprenticeship programs. © 2022, Rajarambapu Institute Of Technology.

Furthermore, it assesses the extent to which characteristics of parents' social networks explain ethnic inequalities in this school-to-work transition. Using longitudinal data from Starting Cohort 4 (ninth-graders) of the National Educational Panel Study, we show that the number of migrant contacts in parents' networks does not affect the outcome of adolescents' apprenticeship search. This applies to both migrant and native adolescents. However, if parents have many native contacts, the chances of adolescents obtaining a company-based apprenticeship increases in both groups. In addition, controlling for the composition of parents' networks substantially reduces the gap between natives and migrants in the transition to dual VET. Further analyses show that this is mainly due to differences in the number of native labour market contacts between native and migrant parents. Our findings indicate that differences in parents' endowment with labour market relevant social capital constitute yet another hurdle for immigrant children in the transition from school to working life.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Additionally, the research introduces the moderating effect of gender in order better to understand under what circumstances apprenticeship reduces the time taken to find employment. Design/methodology/approach: The research proposes PLS equation modelling constructed with a sample of 129 students from the Business Administration and Management degree at Mondragon University. Findings: The research finds that social support and job demand are key features of work that should be addressed to ensure a workplace well-being experience in an apprenticeship programme. In addition, a workplace well-being experience during apprenticeship reduced the time taken by students to access their first job. This means that job training in a company helps students get their first job, but it is not the primary factor. The study also shows that men who had workplace well-being experience in an apprenticeship programme take less time to find their first job. Originality/value: The study proposes an exclusive analysis of apprenticeship programmes in higher education systems from the perspective of workplace well-being experience, based on the DCS model. This research also adds to the literature on apprenticeship by providing evidence that a positive experience of work during an apprenticeship programme facilitates undergraduate students in securing employment. Furthermore, this paper confirms that workplace well-being experiences in apprenticeship programmes constitute a valid tool for tackling youth unemployment, and finds that it is more efficient amongst males than females. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Dual education; Gender; Higher and degree apprenticeships; Well-being; Work-based learning; Youth unemployment","","","","","","","","Agenor P.R., Ozdemir K.K., Pinto Moreira E., Gender gaps in the labour market and economic growth, Economica, 88, 350, (2021); Aivazova N., Role of apprenticeships in combating youth unemployment in Europe and the United States, Peterson Institute for International Economics Policy Brief, pp. 13-20, (2013); Alsubaie M.M., Stain H.J., Webster L.A.D., Wadman R., The role of sources of social support on depression and quality of life for university students, International Journal of Adolescence and Youth, 24, 4, pp. 484-496, (2019); Anderson D.R., Serxner S.A., Gold D.B., Conceptual framework, critical questions, and practical challenges in conducting research on the financial impact of worksite health promotion, American Journal of Health Promotion, 15, 5, (2001); Armstrong J.S., Overton T.S., Estimating nonresponse bias in mail surveys, Journal of Marketing Research, 14, 3, (1977); Bailey T.R., Hughes K.L., Moore D.T., Working knowledge: work-based learning and education reform, Working Knowledge: Work-Based Learning and Education Reform, pp. 1-18, (2003); Bakker A.B., Demerouti E., The job demands‐resources model: state of the art, Journal of Managerial Psychology, 22, 3, pp. 309-328, (2007); Bauernschuster S., Falck O., Heblich S., Training and innovation, Journal of Human Capital, 3, 4, (2009); Bellet C., de Neve J.-E., Ward G., Does employee happiness have an impact on productivity?, SSRN Electronic Journal, pp. 1-61, (2019); Bellmann L., Bender S., Hornsteiner U., Job tenure of two cohorts of young German men 1979-1990: an analysis of the (west-)German employment statistic register sample concerning multivariate failure times and unobserved heterogeneity, SSRN Electronic Journal, (2000); Berton F., Devicienti F., Pacelli L., Are temporary jobs a port of entry into permanent employment?: evidence from matched employer-employee, International Journal of Manpower, 32, 8, (2011); Work-Based Learning as a Pathway to Competence-Based Education, (2019); Blanchflower D.G., Freeman R.B., Youth employment and joblessness in advanced countries, Youth Employment and Joblessness in Advanced Countries, (2013); Bonnal L., Mendes S., Sofer C., School-to-work transition: apprenticeship versus vocational school in France, International Journal of Manpower, 23, 5, (2002); Bonomelli F., Engagement in Apprenticeships: A Cross-National Analysis of School-to-Work Transition Surveys, (2021); Brislin R.W., Back-translation for cross-cultural research, Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 1, 3, pp. 185-216, (1970); Browne J., Benchmarking HRM practices in healthy work organizations, American Business Review, 18, 2, pp. 50-61, (2000); Buedo S., Mujeres Y mercado laboral en La actualidad, Un análisis desde La perspectiva de género: Genéricamente empobrecidas, patriarcalmente desiguales, Revista de Educacion Social, 21, pp. 64-83, (2015); Cahuc P., Hervelin J., Apprenticeship and youth unemployment, SSRN Electronic Journal, (2021); Carmines E., Zeller R., Reliability and Validity Assessment, (1979); Castano C., Llorente R., Las mujeres en la Gran Recesión, Revista de Economía Laboral, 14, 2, pp. 203-205, (2017); Cavaglia C., McNally S., Ventura G., Do apprenticeships pay?

According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, more than 80% of medical schools incorporate simulation based teaching within all four years of the curriculum. Educational activity and setting: The University of Rhode Island College of Pharmacy healthcare simulation lab has developed integrated educational opportunities for both groups of students by offering independent study opportunities that allow BSPS students to collaborate with PharmD students. A recent example of this model includes BSPS student development of patient cases which are integrated into high-fidelity human patient simulators with faculty assistance. A senior BSPS student researched and designed four clinical patient cases which were presented to P3 pharmacy students. Findings: In all four cases, there was an increase in knowledge and attitudes following the simulation. Qualitative comments from students noted the importance of patient education and an enhanced ability to manage disease and side effects. Summary: The nature of the simulation lab at the University of Rhode Island is a platform that can be modeled by other institutions with both PharmD and BSPS programs. © The Author(s) 2022.","bachelor of science pharmaceutical science; case based learning; dual education; interdisciplinary education; pharmacology; PharmD; simulation","Curriculum; Education, Pharmacy; Humans; Learning; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacy; Schools, Pharmacy; Students, Pharmacy; ketone body; drug; anion gap; Article; case report; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; computer simulation; curriculum; diabetic ketoacidosis; dyspnea; fever; glucose blood level; heart rate; hemodynamics; human; human experiment; interdisciplinary education; interprofessional education; knowledge; learning; lung embolism; medical education; medical school; medical student; patient education; pharmacological science; pharmacy (discipline); pharmacy student; problem based learning; questionnaire; Rhode Island; schizophrenia; side effect; simulation; simulation training; teaching; urinalysis; pharmacy (shop); pharmacy education; pharmacy school; pharmacy student","","Pharmaceutical Preparations, ","","","","","Kayyali R., Harrap N., Albayaty A., Et al., Simulation in pharmacy education to enhance interprofessional education, Int J Pharm Pract, 27, 3, pp. 295-302, (2019); Vyas D., Bray B.S., Wilson M.N., Use of simulation-based teaching methodologies in US colleges and schools of pharmacy, Am J Pharm Educ, 77, 3, (2013); Jafari M., A unique degree program for pre-pharmacy education: An undergraduate degree in pharmaceutical sciences, Curr Pharm Teach Learn, 10, 2, pp. 243-251, (2018); Oh P.J., Jeon K.D., Koh M.S., The effects of simulation-based learning using standardized patients in nursing students: A meta-analysis, Nurse Educ Today, 35, 5, pp. e6-e15, (2015); Gorantla S., Bansal U., Singh J.V., Dwivedi A.D., Malhotra A., Kumar A., Introduction of an undergraduate interprofessional simulation based skills training program in obstetrics and gynaecology in India, Adv Simul (Lond), 4, (2019); Brashers V.P.E., Malpass J., Review: Measuring the impact of interprofessional education (IPE) on collaborative practice and patient outcomes, Measuring the Impact of Interprofessional Education on Collaborative Practice and Patient Outcomes, (2015); Crawford S.B., Monks S.M., Mendez M., Quest D., Mulla Z.D., Plavsic S.K., A Simulation-based workshop to improve residents’ collaborative clinical practice, J Grad Med Educ, 11, 1, pp. 66-71, (2019); Gillette C., Dinkins M.M., Bliss R., Et al., Health professions students’ attitudes and perceptions of interprofessional biases, Int J Pharm Pract, 27, 4, pp. 396-398, (2019); Cheema E., The need to introduce simulation-based teaching in pharmacy education in Saudi Arabia, Pharmacy (Basel), 6, 3, (2018); Bauchat J.R., Seropian M., Jeffries P.R., Communication and empathy in the patient-centered care model—why simulation-based training is not optional, Clinical Simulation In Nursing, 12, 8, pp. 356-359, (2016); House J.B., Choe C.H., Wourman H.L., Berg K.M., Fischer J.P., Santen S.A., Efficient and effective use of peer teaching for medical student simulation, West J Emerg Med, 18, 1, pp. 137-141, (2017); Swamy M., Bloomfield T.C., Thomas R.H., Singh H., Searle R.F., Role of SimMan in teaching clinical skills to preclinical medical students, BMC Med Educ, 13, (2013); Fanning R.M., Gaba D.M., The role of debriefing in simulation-based learning, Simul Healthc, 2, 2, pp. 115-125, (2007)","","","SAGE Publications Inc.","","","","","","08971900","","JPPRE","35302930","English","J.

In this multiple-case study, we interviewed school stakeholders and observed various processes such as classes and recitation hours at five Basic High Schools in Ankara, Turkey. The findings mainly revealed that Basic High Schools had a dual education structure in which the formal curricula were implemented and students were prepared for the university entrance examination, with an emphasis on the latter. Teaching to test was prioritized in these shadow schools for profit while most of the aspects of school quality were neglected. Further, since these schools were categorized as private schools, the school fee for these schools, although lower than the elite ones, was affordable for middle and high-socio-economic-status families. Such an approach, we conclude, exacerbated existing educational inequalities in Turkey while widening the achievement gap on the university entrance examination between students from different socioeconomic classes. The findings of this study might help educators and policy-makers in the organization of the schooling process at private schools to eliminate educational inequalities while ensuring quality education for all. © 2022 Turkish Education Association.

To discuss how technical universities can help bridge the resulting “middle-skills gap” without incurring an unwarranted academization of these professions, a two-cycle participatory action research was conducted within the empirical setting of a leading Italian electric-power distribution company. First, an in-depth case study investigated how the advent of smart grids is transforming the work of frontline operation and maintenance workers. Second, a Challenge-Based-Learning intervention was co-designed according to the emerging competency gaps, and tested with two classes involved in the company’s school-based apprenticeship program. The findings contribute to literatures on knowledge creation and transformation by academics, and on developmental universities, respectively: technical universities can design effective challenge-based programs thanks to state-of-the-art laboratories, multidisciplinary research, diverse teaching domains, and a stimulating environment; moreover, they can transfer these innovative research-based teaching methods and restore the socio-economic attractiveness of technical schools and professions, thus playing a developmental role in the middle-skills gap issue. A major policy implication that emerges is the–rather urgent–need to foster initiatives aimed at a deeper integration between upper secondary and higher education systems. © 2021 Society for Research into Higher Education.","Academization; Challenge-Based Learning; developmental universities; digitalization; Vocational Education and Training","","","","","","CLIK; Connection Lab; Politecnico di Torino, POLITO","The authors wish to acknowledge the contribution of E-Distribuzione, of the apprenticeship tutors, both on the company side and on the school side, and of the Politecnico di Torino’s professors, mentors, and CLIK (Connection Lab and Innovation Kitchen) staff.","Acemoglu D., Autor D., Skills, Tasks and Technologies: Implications for Employment and Earnings, Handbook of Labor Economics, 4, pp. 1043-1171, (2011); Arocena R., Goransson B., Sutz J., Knowledge Policies and Universities in Developing Countries: Inclusive Development and the ‘Developmental University’, Technology in Society, 41, pp. 10-20, (2015); Arocena R., Sutz J., (2007); Baartman L.K.J., De Bruijn E., Integrating Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes: Conceptualising Learning Processes Towards Vocational Competence, Educational Research Review, 6, 2, pp. 125-134, (2011); Baethge M., Wolter A., The German Skill Formation Model in Transition: From Dual System of VET to Higher Education?, Journal for Labour Market Research, 48, 2, pp. 97-112, (2015); Balsmeier B., Woerter M., Is This Time Different?

Those competencies can be developed on young people, as a new workforce that joins this market, or with veteran workers who need to be updated to continue current. Several actors are involved, from educational institutions to industry and government. The various international models of skills development in workers focus on tripartite collaboration schemes and the establishment of official standards. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze and describe the existing contextual conditions in Mexico for the development and certification of competencies in Industry 4.0. This study is qualitative and uses document analysis techniques to collect information that is relevant to identify the main elements currently existing. As a result, it is observed the need to strengthen collaboration schemes, as well as to provide the existing national certification system of greater relevance in the worker placement processes. Correspondingly, apprenticeship programs are presented as a field that has not been explored sufficiently within the country context.  © 2013 IEEE.","Apprentice programs; competitiveness; continuing education; Industry 4.0; technical skills certification","Apprentices; Competition; Apprentice program; Certification; Collaboration; Competitiveness; Continuing education; Fourth industrial revolution; Government; Industrial revolutions; Manufacturing; Technical skill certification; Technical skills; Industry 4.0","","","","","","","Lu Y., Industry 4.0: A survey of technologies, applications and open research issues, J.

At various international locations, companies often encounter a “skills ecosystem” that differs to a greater or lesser extent from that of the home country. This article considers this problem and examines German companies in Germany and China and, conversely, Chinese companies in China and Germany. Specifically, it examines (1) how the training cultures of companies differ between the home country and abroad, (2) which influencing factors determine the training cultures realized in each case, and (3) what influence the respective nationally prevailing skills ecosystems specifically exert. The findings from these four perspectives document that German companies in Germany use the formal vocational training system of dual training, whereas German companies in China are strongly influenced by the local training culture of in-company learning. Moreover, Chinese companies in China also use this training, and only cooperate to a limited extent with the formal school-based vocational education and training system. These findings show that Chinese companies in Germany do not adopt the dual training system used in Germany. This article analyses these results and discusses the reasons behind them, drawing of a distinction between institutional logic and internal logic. © 2023 by the authors.","China; Germany; multinational companies; skills ecosystem; training culture; vocational education","","","","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (FU 424/16-1, FU 424/17-1, PI 418/5-1, PI 418/7-1)","This research was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG), grant numbers FU 424/16-1, FU 424/17-1, PI 418/5-1, PI 418/7-1.","Gessler M., Educational transfer as transformation.

We fill this gap by examining entrance and persistence patterns across six cohorts of a large coding and apprenticeship program—LaunchCode (N = 4,868). We then leverage a natural experiment in which LaunchCode adopted more equity-focused admissions policies. We focus on three unique phases of LaunchCode’s program: admissions, course completion, and employment connection through an accompanying apprenticeship program. We conduct five sets of logistic regression models across both individual and combined program phases with separate interaction terms for admissions policy change and race, gender, and entrance exam test scores. Overall, when we combine admission and course completion phases, we find that Black individuals and individuals with lower entrance exam test scores are no longer at a significant disadvantage after the change in admissions policy, while Hispanic individuals and females appear to have a relative advantage. However, when focusing solely on those who were admitted, we observed increased completion rates only among individuals with lower entrance exam test scores. Moreover, we did not observe any instances of increased persistence for these groups in the models that included the apprenticeship phase. These findings demonstrate the promise of equity-focused admissions policies for increasing access to alternative STEM education programs for women and persons of color, as well as the limitations of these policies for increasing persistence for women and persons of color in STEM. © 2023 by Begell House, Inc.","alternative preparation programs; broadening participation; gender; race/ethnicity; STEM","","","","","","","","Statement on Fisher v.

This route into radiography runs in parallel with ‘conventional’ pre-registration programmes where students apply to a higher education institution (HEI) and undertake discrete clinical placements. The aim of this study was to explore the perspectives of pre-registration students on the diagnostic radiographer degree apprenticeship route. Methods: A qualitative approach (online questionnaire) gathered attitudes and opinions of pre-registration students from a single HEI, regarding the degree apprenticeship programme. Participants were pre-registration medical imaging students from all stages of the programme (n = 204). Braun and Clarks's thematic analysis was employed for data analysis. Results: A response rate of 21% (n = 44) was recorded. Four themes emerged from data analysis: (1) misunderstandings surrounding the degree apprenticeship, (2) financial implications and (3) practical experience associated with both degree courses and (4) the experience the pre-registration degree has to offer. Conclusion: There was an apparent lack of understanding regarding the degree apprenticeship leading students to misinterpret aspects of the course. Additionally, students highlighted the earning aspect of the apprenticeship to be an advantage in comparison to student debts associated with the traditional pre-registration programmes. Furthermore, students emphasised the advantage of the clinical focus practice associated with the degree apprenticeship. Nevertheless, students who have selected the HEI route still value what the traditional pre-registration degree offers. Implications for practice: As degree apprenticeship programmes become widely available, a greater awareness should, therefore, follow. In the interim, there is scope for HEIs to seek to raise awareness of degree apprenticeship provision. HEIs should seek to allay any concerns and highlight the benefits of having this alternative route into the profession. © 2022","Apprenticeship; Diagnostic radiography; Education; Training; Vocational education and training; Work-based learning","Humans; Radiography; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires; Universities; adult; apprenticeship; article; awareness; controlled study; data analysis; diagnostic imaging; education; human; human experiment; learning; major clinical study; occupation; questionnaire; radiography; radiological technologist; tertiary education; thematic analysis; undergraduate student; vocational education; medical student; radiography; university","","","","","","","Heales C., Green D., The degree apprenticeship route into diagnostic radiography—implications for the workplace, UKIO, (2020); Price R., Diploma to degree 1976 to 1993, Radiography, 15, pp. e67-e71, (2009); The National skills Academy, Health.

Additionally, strict infection control regulations, as well as temporary school and company closures, inhibit the teaching of practical skills at the workplace. Rapid action by the responsible actors is essential to ensure that VET can take place even under these difficult conditions. It can be assumed that both the complex decision-making processes and the multiplicity of actors involved in collective training systems complicate or delay the reaction to this exogenous shock. Using the example of the German dual training system, this explorative article aims to examine the ability of collective training systems to deal with the challenges posed by the pandemic. Methods: Based on a document analysis, various publications (e.g., press releases, reports) by central actors of the German dual system were reviewed, which provided information about the provision of training activities as well as the measures taken or required to counteract the pandemic-related consequences for dual apprenticeships. This corpus of literature was expanded by scientific studies and publications from national or international institutions related to VET. Following a governance-analytical and actor-centred perspective, the documents were analysed with regard to the indications they provide about the realised coordination of action between the actors, the realised processes and outcomes, as well as the levels affected within the VET system. Findings: The way of dealing with the crisis demonstrates that the German dual system is influenced by the actions of various actors at multiple levels. Actors who are involved in the decision-making processes share common interests, resulting in a strategically bound cooperation among them. However, influence or power from bottom-up seems to be rather limited, as not all of the actors considered in this study are included in essential governance processes. Despite the comprehensive reactions to the pandemic, problems and optimisation needs are also apparent, e.g. with regard to vocational orientation or the support of vocational schools. Conclusion: Despite its complexity, the dual system as a collective training model is capable of acting and adapting to face the challenges posed by the pandemic. This may also be due to the historically entrenched corporatist structures within the dual system: Even in times of crisis, the trust in this historically evolved institutional framework leads to a high degree of accountability and cooperation among the decisive actors. © 2022 European Research Network Vocational Education and Training.

However, the vast majority of University-Business Cooperation (UBC) literature has focused on R&D-related activities. This bias has given rise to a lack of knowledge of the organisational context-related factors that shape businesses’ cooperation with universities. In order to address this research gap, this quantitative study, by means of a series of multivariate linear regression models, identifies the organisational context-related factors that determine manufacturing SMEs’ cooperation levels in education-related UBC activities. Applying a questionnaire to a sample of 332 manufacturing SMEs located in the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country (Spain), the impact is analysed of organisational context-related factors–general business characteristics, business openness, R&D, innovation, and UBC willingness and support–on 5 types of UBC activities that have been identified and classified in the field of education, namely, mobility of students, dual education, curriculum co-design, curriculum co-delivery and lifelong learning. © 2022 Society for Research into Higher Education.","curriculum co-development; dual education; lifelong learning; mobility of students; organisational context-related factors; University-Business cooperation","","","","","","","","Alpaydin U.A.R., Fitjar R.D., Proximity Across the Distant Worlds of University–Industry Collaborations, Papers in Regional Science, 100, 3, pp. 689-711, (2021); Alunurm R., Roigas K., Varblane U., The Relative Significance of Higher Education–Industry Cooperation Barriers for Different Firms, Industry and Higher Education, 34, 6, pp. 377-390, (2020); Azagra-Caro J.M., Et al., Dynamic Interactions Between University-Industry Knowledge Transfer Channels: A Case Study of the Most Highly Cited Academic Patent, Research Policy, 46, 2, pp. 463-474, (2017); Barroso-Hurtado D., Chan R., Why Enrol in a Lifelong Learning Programme?

It reaches back to the pre-1989 times setting the scene for the post-socialist transition. The periods 1989-2010 and post-2010 will be discussed separately as they differ considerably in term of their contexts and characteristics; the first period covers the first free general election and the accession of Hungary to the EU in 2004, the latter period is discussed in the light of the political power of FIDESZ. These events greatly influence the developments and directions of skills formation in Hungary. Between 1989 and 2010 decentralisation, liberalisation and democratisation can be observed, whereas post-2010 is seen as moving towards centralisation, autocracy and nationalism. It is argued that post-1989, VET and adult education and training has experienced considerable and frequent system wide reforms to improve the quality of provision, to link VET to the skills demand and to improve the status of VET. These aspects are discussed in the context of political, economic and societal changes in Hungary. It is argued that VET in Hungary has been in a continual state of flux for several decades. Therefore we demand long term strategic planning of VET and adult education development, and a national skills strategy based on wide social consensus in order to support long-term economic development based on education and training. © Peter Lang GmbH Internationaler Verlag der Wissenschaften Berlin 2022.

It has caused a profound shift in how we conduct our work, with a large-scale take-up of remote working and changes in our digital approach. The way we work is changing. All these impacts challenge the traditional supply chain and working practices of the construction industry negatively, resulting in price escalations, additional costs, loss of revenue, payment delays and increase in disputes and claims. This study aimed to assess the skill proficiency of learners and narrow the employers’ and young engineers’ perspectives on what are the future skills requirements in the construction industry in the world of digitalization. This study, which comprised two surveys entitled “Future Skills—What does the future look like for young engineers?” (for employers) and “WLA Survey in “Future Skills”—The Proficiency Analyses of Young Engineers-to-be” (for learners), was a part of the Workplace Learning and Assessment (WLA) Engagement Series for students. This research attempts to map skill proficiency of learners (or young engineers-to-be) with the future skill requirements of the employers and to make recommendations on the construction-related institutional arrangements. A quantitative approach by using online surveys as the main data collection tool was adopted. A sample of 20 WLA-participating employers and 23 WLA-participating students in construction companies was generated. In December 2021, the project team initiated two surveys to explore the expectation for the future workforce in the construction industry. Interview results covering various construction-related disciplines, including civil engineering, building studies, surveying and building technology, were analysed and illustrated using Microsoft Power BI. Content analysis with data visualizations was used to identify major themes. This study has shown that employers and students have different perceptions of skills and attributes as critical competencies for a successful workforce. On a positive note, there was a high level of satisfaction for both employers and learners in “Training Structure” and “Training and Development”. This study highlighted that students did not have the appropriate level of knowledge as expected by their employers in key subject areas of the construction industry. Employers expressed a clear expectation for the roles and responsibilities of young engineers in their organizations. Areas of practice such as building information modelling (BIM), “Problem Solving”, and “Presentation Skills” were highlighted as critical for the future. The competency of youngsters in achieving targeted vision and goals as well as the competency in striving for continual improvement was identified as highly relevant for the future. There was potential for young engineers to play a more active role in their organizations and to repackage their technical skill and interpersonal skill sets for anticipated future roles. The choice of the quantitative research design approach was guided by the need to capture numerical data in the construction industry of Hong Kong for the purpose of illuminating differences in perspectives among participants about future skills for WLA implementation in vocational and professional education and training (VPET). This study can help to investigate the skill proficiency gaps that employers will be looking for and how WLA can bring maximized benefits to students and companies. Based on the results, the students can be better informed about the workplace settings and be prepared for the upcoming industrial attachment or apprenticeship programme with WLA. Feedback provided by the companies can help support students’ transition into the world of work. On the other hand, by understanding learners’ self-perception, this adaptation made by the companies could result in what looks to be part of a longer-term change in how we work, particularly with a move to increased use of hybrid working. The statistical models with data visualization based on Power BI can also lead to the experimentation and inference that inform the institution’s strategy. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Data visualization; Future skills; Skill proficiency gaps; Vocational and professional education and training; Workplace learning and assessment","","","","","","","","Collin K., Connecting work and learning: design engineers’ learning at work, J Work Learn, 18, pp. 403-413, (2006); Federal Office of Culture (FOC).

It is generally acknowledged that Thailand is trying to adopt the dual system of education, which is a highly-international accepted vocational education management system and has a prototype from Germany. Such efforts have been genuinely used in practice, but in the form of modification, not the entire system used due to legal restrictions, supporting regulations, including there is no any legal obligation for Thai vocational education sector, Industry Federation, the Chamber of Commerce, and industrial sector or establishments to completely commit to the entire dual system of education similar to Germany. But the above reasons, in the matters of incompletion of the regulation, Laws, or legal ties between related sectors, also make the researcher suspicious, as in fact, the dual education system has been officially started for more than 60 years. In 1959, there was an establishment of the “Thai-German Technical School”, with the assistance of the Federal Government of Germany in both economic and academic matters. It is regarded as the beginning the dual system of education was used to train Thai mechanic students for the first time. But, why the readiness is unavailable till these days? Therefore, the comparative study of “Thai-German Technical School” and GTDEE” project should be a challenging topic which is a good comparative and responds to the objectives of this research most. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Centre of excellence; Dual system; Vocational education","","","","","","","","Office of the Vocational Education Commission. a Guide to Vocational Education Assessment for the Royal Award.

The natural complication and the impermanence of the modern world determine the demand of society for persons with cognitive characteristics. Demand does not come only from society it is also a natural realization to anyone who aspires to a full life. Thus, the constant interest for cognitive values is justified, so much so that their personal aspirations and specifics are dependent on the field of defense defined profession, and thus life. The purpose of the study - theoretical support of cognition in students in the context of dual training and experimentally test their effectiveness. Facility - education and training. Subject - obtaining and strengthening the cognition of students in the context of the dual study. A methodology based on a systematic approach, activity-competence approach and self-analysis for professional competencies. Methods: theoretical-methodological analysis of literature, the study of regulatory and program documents from education and production, generalization of business experience, business modelling; comparative analysis Germany and Macedonia by defining the specific organizational-legal conditions and self-analysis of students for professional competencies. Results - aimed at enriching the theory and methodology in correlation with the training. Students to be able, to practice personal deep thinking skills while studying, because the exercise period is too short for them to achieve the concrete advancement of skills. © 2022 Eskisehir Osmangazi University.

These surveys usually comprise both the Likert scale and free-text responses. Since the discrete Likert scale responses are easy to analyze, they feature more prominently in survey analyses. However, the free-text responses often contain richer, detailed, and nuanced information with actionable insights. Mining these insights is more challenging, as it requires a higher degree of processing by human experts, making the process time-consuming and resource intensive. Consequently, the free-text analyses are often restricted in scale, scope, and impact. To address these issues, we propose a novel automated analysis framework for extracting actionable information from free-text responses to open-ended questions in student feedback questionnaires. By leveraging state-of-the-art supervised machine learning techniques and unsupervised clustering methods, we implemented our framework as a case study to analyze a large-scale dataset of 4400 open-ended responses to the National Student Survey (NSS) at a UK university. These analyses then led to the identification, design, implementation, and evaluation of a series of teaching and learning interventions over a two-year period. The highly encouraging results demonstrate our approach’s validity and broad (national and international) application potential—covering tertiary education, commercial training, and apprenticeship programs, etc., where textual feedback is collected to enhance the quality of teaching and learning. © 2022 by the authors.

The aim of this paper is to investigate what competences employers really expect business graduates to have at the end of their studies. The paper introduces the dual higher Vocational Education and Training (VET) model, where full-time students are also full-time employees of cooperative companies. Twelve employers participated in the project and the university signed a contract with them. They agreed to employ the young people under the programme. The roots of the currently existing high VET models – as a concept and structure – can be traced back to the “Stuttgart Model”, and to the first attempt at merging vocational training and theoretical knowledge in the 1970s. This model, in slightly different forms, has been adapted in many Member States of the European Union and has gained momentum in Hungary. BBS has been very successful in delivering this model since 2017. The project is purported to improve the efficiency of dual higher VET by joint education and competence-development with employers, who were interviewed about their expectations. The authors of this paper have analysed the employers’ responses and have made recommendations for developing dual higher VET programs accordingly. © 2022 by Cherkas Global University All rights reserved.

Empirical analyses have been concerned almost exclusively with the linguistic development of foreign language learners, who do not receive specific training to become language teachers. Purpose: Due to the lack of literature regarding simultaneous linguistic and didactic training with pre-service foreign language teachers, this exploratory classroom-based research analyses a case of linguistic and didactic dual training for pre-service primary education teachers of German in Spain, both when being trained to work as foreign language teachers, or as CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning) teachers. The objective is to assess the effectiveness of the dual training by measuring the degree of the pre-service teachers’ (N=4) willingness to communicate (WTC) before and after each practice session (N=14). This is a mixed-methods research where data were collected through (i) a questionnaire answered by the pre-service teachers and (ii) the lecturer’s linguistic and didactic excursuses. Results: The results show a high degree of WTC among the pre-service teachers, mainly as result of the Instructed Foreign Language Acquisition (IFLA)-based teaching practice model implemented, including linguistic training in German and didactic training (e.g., excursuses) in Spanish (L1). Factors like grouping increase the pre-service teachers’ WTC, while factors like talking to someone they know little about decrease it. However, personal traits need to be considered when it comes to WTC, even with individuals who share similar language proficiency. Implication: The innovation of this teacher training methodology lies in the coordinated combination of linguistic (i.e., IFLA-based teaching model) and didactic training. IFLA-based teaching practices are evaluated positively by the pre-service teachers in terms of linguistic and didactic training and WTC. Final recommendations are suggested about teaching methodology. © 2022 National Research University Higher School of Economics.

Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory case study approach was employed to gain insight into the characteristics. The data sources used to inform this study included surveys and artifacts from eight URMU students who participated in a national grant-funded research apprenticeship fellowship program. Findings: Results revealed three key findings about the characteristics that research mentors need to possess to successfully support URMU students in education research. These characteristics include a willingness to (1) invest time and effort in the mentor–mentee relationship, (2) share relevant knowledge and expertise about education research and (3) serve as sponsors to support and promote their mentees' educational research goals and endeavors. Practical implications: The results have the potential to improve the quality of successful research mentorship opportunities for URMU students in education research by demonstrating the qualities and importance of these mentoring relationships. Higher quality mentoring relationships have the power to encourage URMU students to persist into graduate school and/or the education research profession via knowledge sharing, support and social capital. This is particularly important as education research – which still largely privileges Eurocentric research perspectives and methods – continues to take much needed steps toward racial and cultural diversity. Originality/value: Most undergraduate research mentorship literature – and especially that literature highlighting the needs of URMU students – focuses on students in STEM, leaving gaps in knowledge related to students in education research. By focusing on the latter, this study seeks to extend our knowledge of the research mentorship needs of URMU students in education research. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Education research; Qualitative case study; Research mentors; Underrepresented racially minoritized undergraduate students","","","","","","Institute of Education Sciences, IES","The authors would like to thank the participants and their colleagues for their time and effort; a special thanks goes to Dr Megan Stump and Lindsey Allen for their invaluable support and contributions throughout the writing process.

Within construction, the most severe worker scarcities are in building trade occupations. In the U.S., though women represent just under half of employed adults, they consist of approximately 3% of trades workers. Thus, increasing women’s participation in building trade occupations is one method of addressing workforce needs. A case study methodology examined qualitative data from in-depth interviews highlighting women’s entry into the building trades. Findings indicate one key element used to bring more women into trades occupations are trainings referred to as pre-apprenticeship programs. Examination of existing pre-apprenticeship programs within the framework of adult educational theory suggests programs use numerous methods of introducing and training women workers to enter the trades that align with education practices allowing for a changing of perspective and enhanced cultural understanding matching transformative learning methodologies. Conclusions suggest practices honed through decades of work in pre-apprenticeship program procedures could be better supported by unions, contractors, and non-profit organizations to increase the numbers and retention of tradeswomen and, thus, support the worker needs of the overall industry. © 2020 Associated Schools of Construction.","adult education theories; occupational segregation by gender; pre-apprenticeship; Tradeswomen; workforce Training","","","","","","","","Eighty percent of contractors report difficulty finding qualified craft workers to hire as association calls for measures to rebuild workforce, (2018); Baxter P., Jack S., Qualitative Case Study Methodology: Study Design and Implementation for Novice Researchers, The Qualitative Report, 13, 4, pp. 544-559, (2008); Berik G., Bilginsoy C., Still a wedge in the door: Women training for the construction trades in the USA, International Journal of Manpower, 27, 4, pp. 321-341, (2006); Berik G., Bilginsoy C., Williams L.S., Gender and racial training gaps in Oregon apprenticeship programs, Labor Studies Journal, 36, 2, pp. 221-244, (2011); Bounds D., A how-to guide for recruiting millennials to construction, Construction Executive, (2019); Bridges D., Wulff E., Bamberry L., Krivokapic-Skoko B., Jenkins S., Negotiating gender in the male-dominated skilled trades: A systematic literature review, Construction Management and Economics, pp. 1-23, (2020); Cha Y., Overwork and the persistence of gender segregation in occupations, Gender & Society, 27, 2, (2013); Clarke L., Herrmann G., Skill shortages, recruitment and retention in the house building sector, Personnel Review, 36, 4, pp. 509-527, (2007); Correll S.J., Gender and the career choice process: The role of biased self-assessments, American Journal of Sociology, 106, 6, pp. 1691-1730, (2001); Diekman A.B., Weisgram E.S., Belanger A.L., New routes to recruiting and retaining women in STEM: Policy implications of a communal goal congruity perspective, Social Issues and Policy Review, 9, 1, pp. 52-88, (2015); Ericksen J.A., Schultheiss D.E.P., Women pursuing careers in trades and construction, Journal of Career Development, 36, 1, pp. 68-89, (2009); Gross A., Marcus J., (2018); Hegewisch A., Hartmann H., Occupational segregation and the gender wage gap: A job half done, Institute for Women’s Policy Research, (2014); Hegewisch A., O'Farrell B., Women in the construction trades: Earnings, workplace discrimination, and the promise of green jobs (Report of the findings from the IWPR tradeswomen survey), (2015); Kelly M., Wilkinson L., Evaluation of pre-apprenticeship and retention services in the trades, (Final report funded by the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries (BOLI) and the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT)’s Highway Construction Workforce Development Program), (2017); Knowles M.S., The modern practice of adult education: From pedagogy to andragogy: Revised and updates, (1980); March M.T., How contractors use tech to attract, retain younger workers, Construction Dive, (2018); Mastracci S.H., Breaking out of the pink-collar ghetto: Policy solutions for non-college women, (2004); Menches C.L., Abraham D.M., Women in construction—tapping the untapped resource to meet future demands, Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 133, 9, pp. 701-707, (2007); Merriam S.B., Adult learning theory: Evolution and future directions, PAACE Journal of Lifelong Learning, 26, pp. 21-37, (2017); Paap K., Working construction: Why white working-class men put themselves—and the labor movement—in harm’s way, (2006); R: A language and environment for statistical computing, R Foundation for Statistical Computing in Vienna, Austria, (2014); “Adult learning theories.” TEAL center fact sheet no. 11: Adult learning theories, (2011); BLS reports: Women in the labor force: A databook, (2018); Wirtz R.A., Job growth since the recession: A long, slow rehab, Fedgazette, (2015); Worthen H., Haynes A., Getting in: The experience of minority graduates of the building bridges project pre-apprenticeship class, Labor Studies Journal, 28, 1, pp. 31-52, (2003)","H.E.

Through analysis of documents from 1920 when student nurse service, a nurse apprentice model, was the norm to 1960 when the nurse apprentice model was waning in favor of registered nurse service, this study found that the replacement of student nurses with registered nurses led to weakened standardization of fundamental bedside care and the introduction of large numbers of unlicensed nursing assistants. While student nurses could perform all the functions of fully qualified graduate nurses, nursing assistants could not, resulting in a separation of fundamental nursing care from the professional nurse role and changes in assumptions and attitudes toward fundamental care. These changes had a negative effect on fundamental nursing care. New apprenticeship programs provide opportunities for improvement. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","basic nursing; fundamental nursing; history; hospital staffing; nurse apprentice; nurse's aide; nursing; student nurse","Education, Nursing; History, 20th Century; Humans; Nurse's Role; United States; apprenticeship; article; clinical article; hospital personnel; human; nurse; nurse attitude; nursing assistant; nursing care; nursing student; registered nurse; role change; standardization; history; nurse attitude; nursing education; United States","","","","","Brigham Young University College of Nursing","This research was supported by a research grant from the Brigham Young University College of Nursing.

Practice-oriented (dual) education is one of the most effective ways to address this problem. The innovation of this study is that for the first time a theoretical and practical model for involving all stakeholders in this process has been created and tested. The aim of the article is to substantiate a socially responsible dual education system in an unstable environment. METHODS: In terms of objective, this is an applied and quantitative study. The study population is estimated at 13 universities, 10 companies, 50 students between November 2021 and November 2022. The sample size is estimated using the Cochrane formula. A standard 5-point Likert scale questionnaire was used to collect data, where groups of questions corresponded to 4 hypotheses. All data were investigated by factor and cluster analysis using STATISTICA software (version 10.0). FINDINGS: All four hypotheses were confirmed. Before the war, the first and second hypotheses were prioritized. According to them, the process approach of social responsibility of dual education allows designing and launching a system of social responsibility of dual education and creating a talent pool at the employing enterprise. After the outbreak of hostilities, the priorities changed. The third and fourth hypotheses allow, through the organization of supportive (enabling) processes, to ensure the effective functioning of the system. As a result, the majority of stakeholders (31%) consider it necessary to modernize the mentoring system and provide graduates with relevant professional skills, while methodological and career guidance came in second and third (16% and 13% respectively). CONCLUSION: Using the theoretical and practical model of formation and implementation of dual education in the unstable conditions of Ukraine will help to solve the problems of the country out of crisis, post-war recovery of higher education system, to bring the requirements of production with the possibilities of training specialists in universities and can be applied in other countries in a similar situation. © 2023 The author(s).","Factor analysis; Mentoring; Practice-oriented learning; Stakeholders","","","","","","","","Ante G., Ken K., The effects of perceived corporate social responsibility on employee attitudes, Bus.

This form is a methodological characteristic of vocational education; it involves the coordinated interaction of the educational and industrial spheres of training qualified personnel with a certain profile within the framework of different organizational forms of education. The main objectives of introducing elements of the dual form of training are to eliminate the main shortcomings of traditional forms and methods of training future skilled workers, to bridge the gap between theory and practice, education and production, and to improve the quality training qualified personnel, taking into account the requirements of employers within framework new organizational-different forms of training. Justified structural components of the dual form of education are revealed: organization of cooperation between politicians, business, and social partners; development of a legislative framework for the recognition of national standards for the quality of vocational education; in-service training for students; involvement of qualified production personnel in pedagogical activity (instructors, teachers); implementation of institutional research and consulting (monitoring the quality of the provision of educational services in the field of vocational education, updating educational standards). © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Dual Education; Educational Policies; Employer; Methods; Sustainable Development Education; Technology; Training","Apprentices; Sustainable development; Dual education; Educational policy; Employer; Method; Professional training; Qualified personnel; Skilled workers; Sustainable development education; Technology; Vocational education; Personnel training","","","","","","","Drozich I., Smimanovskyi M., Organization Dual Form of Education in Institutions of Vocational Education: Pract.

Design/methodology/approach: Forty stakeholders participated in a mixed methods-based group concept mapping (GCM) approach, representing the tripartite relationship of an EMBA apprenticeship. This approach allowed the deconstruction and shared understanding of the value proposition of higher degree apprenticeships. Findings: Analysis identified seven conceptualised value clusters around an eight central cluster “Professional Development”. Two regions of meaning were identified: the personal dimensions of apprentices and their contribution within and to their organisation. Findings showed that a work-based designed curriculum improves confidence and communication skills and that much of the value proposition is personal and self-managed by the apprentices. The tripartite relationship was shown to be incomplete and inconsistent, particularly regarding mentoring and reflective practice. Practical implications: The pandemic has brought about significant changes in business practice. This study identifies several areas for improving higher degree apprenticeship pedagogy in readiness for the new business landscape, as well as identifying limitations of the tripartite relationship. Originality/value: The study addresses a gap in the literature by exploring the value proposition an EMBA apprenticeship programme. The interrelatedness of cluster concepts has identified value elements missing from previous apprenticeship delivery. Deconstructing the senior leader apprenticeship enables educators to redesign and refine models of engagement for improving the apprenticeship experience. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Executive MBA; Higher degree apprenticeships; Mentoring; Reflection/reflective practice; Vocational education and training; Work-based learning","","","","","","University of Quebec, (5154_e_2021); De Montfort University, DMU, (036_2021)","The authors would like to acknowledge their respective institutions for financial support and to express their gratitude to all participants for their time, engagement and insightful perspectives at the various research steps.

Over time these numbers increased significantly, more and more training areas were also involved including engineering, information technology, agriculture, economic, as well as other BSc studies. In 2019, 303 undergraduate students were studying in dual form at our University and the number of industrial partners training students has increased to 40. Looking back over the past eight years, it became important to review and analyse the students' so far achieved results. The aim of our study was to examine the student learning outcomes of dual and non-dual students with particular regard to student dropout. In the research, we compared weighted learning outcome averages and correlative credit indexes of dual and non-dual students to measure student performance for the period between 2015 and 2019. The results revealed that both the credit index and the weighted learning outcome average of dual students surpassed that of non-dual students at Engineering and Computer Science Faculty. According to the data referring to courses, operating in dual training forms dropout among dual students is significantly lower than among non-dual students. Dropout data may also indicate that due to its nature dual training proves to be a more efficient ' handrail' to take part in the training, it can be stated that a sort of cohesion, positive ' community consciousness' are present among dual students supporting motivation to follow their studies, attending the institution. © 2022 IEEE.","credit index; dual education; student dropout; student learning outcomes","Engineering education; Personnel training; Credit indices; Dual education; Higher education institutions; Hungary; Industrial partners; John von Neumann; Learning outcome; Non-dual; Student dropout; Student learning outcomes; Students","","","","","","","Astin A.W., What Matters in College?

At the same time, interna­tional innovation research argues that a large percentage of academic graduates (rather than vocational education graduates) is indispensable for strong innovation perfor­mance. How can this contradiction be explained? In this survey, Uschi Backes-Gellner and Patrick Lehnert review the latest research findings to show why German-speaking countries are highly innovative not in spite but because of their strong vocational education systems. Necessary insti­tutional framework conditions for this effect include the future-oriented design and updating of vocational training curricula, the teaching of broad vocational (rather than narrow firm-specific) skills in dual vocational education and training programs, a permeable education system with attractive career paths, and a link between tertiary voca­tional education and applied research. © The Author(s), 2023.","","Germany;

During this process, the European Union (EU) has exercised an extensive influence. This paper advances the analysis of the role exercised by the EU in this stage of cross-national attraction by analysing the model of VET governance promoted by European institutions. The methodology consists of a reflexive thematic analysis of the EU VET texts. A total of 35 texts from the EU institutions was analysed by using NVivo. This produced three themes under the overarching theme of fostering a more pluralistic governance system: promoting cooperation among stakeholders in the design, management and financing of the system, enhancing social dialogue and strengthening responsiveness to change in the world of work. This analysis concludes that the EU, as an agent of the policy transfer process, encourages the implementation of a cooperative governance model of VET systems, such as that present in the dual VET systems of certain member states with collective skill formation governance regimens such as Germany, Austria and Denmark. © 2022 by the authors.","apprenticeships; collective skill formation; governance; policy analysis; policy transfer; vocational education and training","","","","","","Ministry of Science and Innovation of the Government of Spain, (RTI2018-101660-B-I00); Ministry of Universities of the Government of Spain, (FPU 19/02739)","This research was funded by the Ministry of Science and Innovation of the Government of Spain, grant number RTI2018-101660-B-I00 and by the Ministry of Universities of the Government of Spain, grant number FPU 19/02739.","Aleman-Falcon J., Calcines-Pinero M.A., La internacionalización del Sistema Dual de Formación Profesional Alemán: Factores para su implementación en otros países, Education Policy Analysis Archives, 30, (2022); Ante C., Introduction, The Europeanisation of Vocational Education and Training, pp. 1-33, (2016); Barabasch A., Methodological and Theoretical Approaches to the Study of Governance and Policy Transfer in Vocational Education and Training, Research in Comparative and International Education, 5, pp. 224-236, (2010); Benz A., Governance—Modebegriff oder nützliches sozialwissenschaftliches Konzept?, Governance—Regieren in komplexen Regelsystemen: Eine Einführung, pp. 11-28, (2004); Benz A., Luetz S., Schimank U., Simonis G., Handbuch Governance: Theoretische Grundlagen Und Empirische Anwendungsfelder, (2007); Braun V., Clarke V., Thematic Analysis: A Practical Guide, (2021); Burgi R., Gonon P., Varieties Within a Collective Skill Formation System: How VET Governance in Switzerland Is Shaped by Associations, International Journal for Research in Vocational Education and Training, 8, pp. 46-64, (2021); Busemeyer M., Trampusch C., The Political Economy of Collective Skill Formation Systems, (2012); Cort P., The Open Method of Co-Ordination in Vocational Education and Training—A Triangle of Eu Gov-ernance, Research of vs Research for Education Policy: In an Era of Transnational Policy-Making, (2009); Cowen R., Acting Comparatively upon the Educational World: Puzzles and Possibilities, Oxford Review of Education, 32, pp. 561-573, (2006); Dimitrova A., Boroda M., Chulitskaya T., Berbeca V., Parvan T., Soft, Normative or Transformative Power: What Do the EU’s Communications with Eastern Partners Reveal About Its Influence?, (2016); Davoine E., Deitmer L., German Dual Training through Apprenticeships: An Exportable Model?, The Success of Apprenticeships, pp. 133-141, (2020); Dolowitz D., Marsh D., Learning from Abroad: The Role of Policy Transfer in Contemporary Policy-Making, Governance, 13, pp. 5-23, (2000); Echeverria B., Transferencia Del Sistema de FP Dual a España, Revista de Investigación Educativa, 34, pp. 295-314, (2016); Emmenegger P., Seitzl L., Social Partner Involvement in Collective Skill Formation Governance.

This paper looks at the introduction of dual VET in the Basque Country within the Spanish and European contexts. Based on an analysis of existing official information and literature as well as qualitative research carried out by the authors, the distinctive characteristics of the Basque system are documented and studied. It is shown that there has been a continuity in the ideas and relationships which have configured its trajectory from the early 1980s onwards, and that new instruments and elements of the system have been developed in the region even before those elements were fully formalised at national level in Spain. © 2023 The Vocational Aspect of Education Ltd.","Basque Country; dual; education policy; Spain; VET","","","","","","Department of Education of the Basque Government, (2018-2021, PIBA2018/60)","This work was supported by the Department of Education of the Basque Government, PIBA Basic and applied research projects call (2018-2021), project No. PIBA2018/60 ","Albizu E., Olazaran M., Lavia C., Otero B., Relationships Between Vocational Training Centres and Industrial SMEs in the Basque Country: A Regional Innovation System Approach, Intangible Capital, 7, 2, pp. 329-355, (2011); Albizu E., Olazaran M., Lavia C., Otero B., Comunidad Autónoma del País Vasco, Entorno regional y formación profesional, pp. 189-217, (2013); Barrientos-Sanchez D., Martin-Artiles A., Lope Pena A., Carrasquer Oto P., La FP dual y la transición de los jóvenes al Mercado de trabajo: la vision de los agentes sociales, Anuario IET de Trabajo y relaciones Laborales, 6, pp. 75-94, (2019); Busemeyer M., Trampusch C., The Comparative Political Economy of Collective Skill Formation, The Political Economy of Collective Skill Formation, pp. 3-38, (2012); Vocational Education and Training in Spain.

Design/methodology/approach: The 5C protocol distinguishes five categories of drivers and barriers of education reforms: commitment, capacity, clients, content and context. The authors build on the 5C protocol to develop a qualitative empirical framework based on semi-structured interviews amongst stakeholders. Findings: The results show that involved actors are committed. Capacity in terms of available resources also represents an implementation driver, but companies lack information about the programme. Consequently, industry associations should receive a more prominent role in the motivation of companies to provide training places. The content category is the most challenging implementation barrier because the programme represents a substantial change, compared to the current vocational education and training (VET) programmes in Nepal. Originality/value: First, the authors propose a framework for a qualitative content analysis to analyse the drivers and barriers of implementing and scaling-up education reforms. Second, the authors provide novel information about drivers and barriers of an education reform in Nepal. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Determinant framework; Dual vocational education and training; Education reform; Implementation; Scaling-up","","","","","","Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation; Swiss National Science Foundation; Direktion für Entwicklung und Zusammenarbeit, DEZA; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF","Funding text 1: The authors thank CTEVT and ENSSURE project for their support in communication and linkage with the apprentices and the host companies for necessary information.

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative approach was used to collect and analyse data from a sample set of built environment degree apprenticeship stakeholders. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 key stakeholders to collate emerging themes on their perceptions of the impacts of the pandemic and strategies to adopted to minimise it. Findings: The investigation reveals that the core impacts of Covid-19 on the apprentices training programme are lack of access to the site, furlough, limited access to off the job training, limited interaction with tutors and peers, too much time on the screen, limited pastoral care and lack of contact with a mentor. The census from the research participants is that despite the development and gain with the various virtual platform used during pandemic physical meetings with their mentor remain pivotal to the built environment apprentices learning and training. Practical implications: The results provide relevant stakeholders and actors supporting degree apprentices training programmes (training providers and employers, among others) with the information needed to improve the delivery of built environment degree apprenticeship training programmes during a disruptive event Covid-19. The study identifies various strategies to minimise the impact of disruptive events on the apprentices training, including technology, regular meeting with mentors online, and personal and pastoral care. Originality/value: The study is the first to document the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on degree apprenticeship programs in the built environment. This study provides an in-depth understanding of how these programs have been affected and offers potential solutions to reduce or mitigate potential damage. The research will inform future policy decisions related to degree apprenticeship programs in the built environment. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Built environment; Covid-19; Degree apprenticeship; Higher education; Pandemic","Uncertainty analysis; Apprentice training; Apprenticeship programs; Built environment; Case-studies; Covid-19; Degree apprenticeship; Disruptive event; High educations; Pandemic; Training program; Apprentices","","","","","","","Abdelhamid K., ElHawary H., Gorgy A., Alexander N., Mentorship resuscitation during the COVID‐19 pandemic, AEM Education and Training, 5, 1, (2021); Abdel-Wahab M., Rethinking apprenticeship training in the British construction industry, Journal of Vocational Education and Training, 64, 2, pp. 145-154, (2012); Adesi M., Ewuga D., Owusu-Manu D.-G., Boateng F., Kissi E., COVID-19 pandemic disruptions and environmental turbulence in architectural, engineering and construction project delivery space, International Journal of Building Pathology and Adaptation, (2023); Ahmed S., Haq I., Anam S.M.A., Impacts of COVID-19 on the construction sector in the least developed countries, International Journal of Building Pathology and Adaptation, (2022); Akulwar-Tajane I., Parmar K.K., Naik P.H., Shah A.V., Rethinking screen time during COVID-19: impact on psychological well-being in physiotherapy students, International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, 4, pp. 201-216, (2020); Alsharef A., Banerjee S., Uddin S.M., Albert A., Jaselskis E., Early impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the United States construction industry, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 18, 4, (2021); Alsoud A.R., Harasis A.A., The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on student's E-learning experience in Jordan, Journal of Theoretical and Applied Electronic Commerce Research, 16, pp. 1404-1414, (2021); Baker D., Potential implications of degree apprenticeships for healthcare education, Higher Education, Skills and Work-Based Learning, 9, 1, pp. 2-17, (2019); Bao W., COVID‐19 and online teaching in higher education: a case study of Peking University, Human Behavior and Emerging Technologies, 2, 2, pp. 113-115, (2020); Bernard R.M., Abrami P.C., Borokhovski E., Wade C.A., Tamim R.M., Surkes M.A., Bethel E.C., A meta-analysis of three types of interaction treatments in distance education, Review of Educational Research, 79, 3, pp. 1243-1289, (2009); Bilginsoy C., Unemployment, the great recession, and apprenticeship attrition in the USS, Journal of Vocational Education and Training, 70, 2, pp. 171-192, (2018); Bryman A., Social Research Methods, (2012); Bryman A., Social Research Methods, (2016); Bryman A., Burgess R.G., Reflections on qualitative data analysis, Analyzing Qualitative Data, pp. 216-226, (1994); Burns D., Dagnall N., Holt M., Assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on student wellbeing at universities in the United Kingdom: a conceptual analysis, Frontiers in Education, 5, (2020); Campbell S., Greenwood M., Prior S., Shearer T., Walkem K., Young S., Bywaters D., Walker K., Purposive sampling: complex or simple?

The author researched the legislative acts determining the institutional conditions of educational activities, as well as information contained in the reports of the State Statistics Service since 1995. It was found that along with the positive consequences of reforms in higher education, they were accompanied by threats to educational institutions. They should be taken into account not only by the developers of the state educational policy, but also by the providers of educational services in order to make amendments to the strategies developed by them. Otherwise, the country will face a slowdown in the expanded reproduction of intellectual capital required by the economy.

Dual training combines vocational education at training centres with on-the-job training in workshops during the week. Graduates of this programme receive a certificate of professional qualification (Certificat de Qualification Professionnelle – CQP). For this qualitative research, the authors visited 7 training centres and 39 workshops to make direct observations. Using a life-history approach, they conducted formal and informal interviews with craftspeople and semi-structured interviews with CQP graduates, non-CQP graduates, professional association personnel, training centre staff and CQP trainers. This research was carried out in Parakou, the most important city in central and northern Benin. In total, 96 individuals were interviewed, using purposive selection to pick actors from professional associations, convenience sampling with non-CQP graduates and snowball sampling to reach other participants. The study is underpinned by social change theory, with an emphasis on the factors and agents of change. The research findings indicate that dual training has a favourable impact on skills development, competency transfer and job performance in the crafts sector. CQP graduates benefit from both theoretical knowledge and practical expertise gained during their training. Those who succeed in finding a job or even setting up their own workshop contribute to building a competence-based approach to apprenticeships and stand out in the competitive labour market. Craftspeople who are unable to stand out in the labour market face employment insecurity. The majority of the CQP graduates interviewed had developed high self-esteem and were proud of their valuable knowledge and their ability to deliver high-quality services to satisfied clients. This also affected their relationship with older generations of craftspeople in terms of contradictions in the execution of specific tasks in occupations. © 2023, UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning and Springer Nature B.V.","Apprenticeship; Benin; Competence-based approach; Dual training; Labour market competition; Pedagogical transformation","Benin [West Africa]; Borgou; Parakou; certification; competitiveness; craft production; labor market; training; vocational education","","","","","Danish Development agency; Department of TVET; Swiss Development Cooperation; World Bank Group, WBG; Direktion für Entwicklung und Zusammenarbeit, DEZA; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF; Agence Française de Développement, AFD","Funding text 1: A study conducted to assess the effects of this pilot experience found that skills learning improved (Walther ). As a result, the Benin government turned to donors for further technical and financial assistance. In 2002, Swisscontact, a foundation dedicated to the implementation of international development projects, was asked to provide its expertise to support the government in implementing its apprenticeship reform. Swisscontact launched dual apprenticeship training in 2003 with financial support from the Danish Development agency, the Swiss Development Cooperation, the World Bank, the French Development Agency and others (Davodoun ). ; Funding text 2: Gauthier O. C. Atindehou () highlights the actors engaged in the delivery of this dual training in Benin, as well as the funding, which is mostly supported by foreign donors’ aid. Elsewhere, we have pointed out that the allocation of roles between the public and private sectors in the execution of this dual training is ineffective (Bankolé et al. ). According to the findings of this research, public institutions play a major role in the governance and management of this dual training. Also in an earlier article (Nouatin ), the author assessed the level of engagement of professional associations in the implementation of dual apprenticeship training in Benin. According to his conclusion, while the private sector is heavily involved in implementation and plays a moderate part in the curriculum design phase, it has little engagement in the programme during the evaluation phase (ibid.). Moïse Emmanuel David-Gnahoui and Madoué Florentine Akouété-Hounsinou () conducted an assessment study of this dual training in Benin. Their findings revealed inconsistencies in its execution, and the financial challenge. Edouard Yokossi () studied the development of skills learning using a competence-based approach in Benin. He demonstrates how vocational skills were created using the Developing a Curriculum (DACUM) method (ibid.). In a recent article (Bankolé and Nouatin ), the first two authors of the present article have outlined in broad terms the discrepancies between the concept of Benin’s dual apprenticeships as they were conceptualised, and how they are implemented in practice. Furthermore, they found that this dual system has boosted apprentices’ social cognitive capacities (ibid.). ; Funding text 3: We thank the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) for financing the LELAM TVET4INCOME project research under which this research was conducted. We are grateful for the input and logistical support of Dr Ursula Renold, Principal Investigator of the LELAM project.

The analysis offers a conceptual description of a model of social enterprise established by a regional self-government authority, that blends dual education and social economy and serves as an innovative agent of change. Case research was the approach used. The research revealed that the motivation behind the enterprise was social integration, increasing attractiveness of agriculture for young people and regional self-sufficiency. The partnership was recognized as the key element of the model design. The model brings social, economic and environmental change to employees and students but also to the whole environment. Such a model could be replicated and such collaboration could be put on the map of social enterprises.  © 2022 Marcela Chreneková et al.","business model; dual education; partnership; social agriculture; social enterprise","Slovakia; business; education; industrial enterprise; institutional framework","","","","","National Project Institute of social economy; Slovenská Akadémia Vied, SAV; Ministerstvo školstva, vedy, výskumu a športu Slovenskej republiky","The article was prepared in the framework of the National Project Institute of social economy (Implementation agency of the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the Slovak Republic) and project Models of social agriculture as a tool of inclusive growth (Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic and Slovak Academy of Sciences).","Anderson A.R., Lent M.D., Enterprising the rural; Creating a social value chain, Journal of Rural Studies, 70, pp. 96-103, (2017); Barnova S., Gabrhelova G., Hlasna-Krasna S., Dual system of vocational education and training in Slovakia, INTED 2020 Proceedings, pp. 4592-4596, (2020); Battilana J., Leca B., Boxenbaum E., How actors change institutions: Towards a theory of institutional entrepreneurship, Academy of Management Annals, 3, 1, pp. 65-107, (2009); Bhattacherjee A., Social Science Research: Principles, Methods, and Practices, (2012); Bornstein D., How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas, (2003); Ciepielewska-Kowalik A., Starnawska M., Szymanska A., Pielinski B., Social Enterprise in Poland: Institutional and Historical Context, Social Enterprise in Central and Eastern Europe.

However, there are hardly any studies that contribute to a general overview of this field of research that would facilitate access to knowledge. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to provide a detailed and international picture of Dual Vocational Education and Training (DVET). To this end, a systematic literature review was carried out in Web of Science (WoS), yielding a total of seventy-three papers which were subjected to bibliometric analysis. The main findings show that this is a fragmented research area despite the recent and intense growth of its production. It also highlights an intensive international collaboration between authors and institutions. Finally, the need to continue with this field of study is underlined, while future lines of research are highlighted. © 2023 Common Ground Research Networks.

This aims to improve the accessibility of construction industry practitioners to instructors and ensure more significant interaction of students with their communities of practice (COP). The project will determine users' learning-driven preferences and develop many-to-many matching algorithms. Users will evaluate the ConPEC platform, and the matching algorithms will be improved to ensure enhanced equitable matching. The project will investigate the ConPEC platform's influence on students' disciplined perception and professional identity development. Substantive theories would be developed to explain how improved accessibility, enabled by the ConPEC framework, improves the disciplined perception and professional identity development of construction engineering students. In addition to improved accessibility to construction COP, this project would contribute to the diversity of the nation's construction workforce and strengthen diverse forms of industry-academia interactions. Also, the platform, developed theories, and algorithms can be adapted by high schools, community colleges, and researchers to develop other technological solutions to enhance the development of students in various disciplines. The deployment of ConPEC will also produce diverse datasets for engineering education researchers, institutions, and policymakers. These data include concentration areas, current and future directions of the industry, and the extent to which institutions are preparing students to meet the demands of the industry. ConPEC will also facilitate industries' supply chain through apprenticeship programs and talent pipelines that are currently fragmented. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.","","Construction industry; Engineering education; Personnel; Professional aspects; Supply chains; Communities of Practice; Construction communities; Construction engineering; Construction workforces; Educational community; Many to many; Matching algorithm; Matchings; Professional community; Professional identity; Students","","","","","","","London J.S., Et al., Board 92: Using Mixed Reality and the Three Apprenticeships Framework to Design Head-, Hand-and Heart-focused Learning Experiences for Civil Engineering Students, 2019 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition, (2019); Cappelli P.H., Skill gaps, skill shortages, and skill mismatches: Evidence and arguments for the United States, ILR Review, 68, 2, pp. 251-290, (2015); Bakhshi H., Et al., The future of skills: Employment in 2030, (2017); Building America's skilled technical workforce, (2017); Beckley M., Unrivaled: Why America will remain the world's sole superpower, (2018); Makarius E.E., Srinivasan M., Addressing skills mismatch: Utilizing talent supply chain management to enhance collaboration between companies and talent suppliers, Business Horizons, 60, 4, pp. 495-505, (2017); Employment by detailed occupation, (2019); Workforce C, Help Wanted 2012: Addressing the Skills Gap, (2012); Ahn Y.H., Annie R.P., Kwon H., Key competencies for US construction graduates: An industry perspective, Journal of Professional Issues in Engineering Education and Practice, 138, 2, pp. 123-130, (2012); Hegazy T., Et al., Hands-on exercise for enhancing students' construction management skills, Journal of construction engineering and Management, 139, 9, pp. 1135-1143, (2013); Cooke-Davies T., The “real” success factors on projects, International journal of project management, 20, 3, pp. 185-190, (2002); Davis K., Different stakeholder groups and their perceptions of project success, International Journal of project management, 32, 2, pp. 189-201, (2014); Gido J., Clements J.P., Successful Project Management (with Microsoft Project and InfoTrac), (2008); Gegenfurtner A., What is seen on the screen?

This problem is due to the lack of actual work experience in the industry for vocational teachers. One of the vocational skills improvement programs that are considered adequate is the industrial apprenticeship program. Many studies discuss apprenticeships, but there are still limited studies that examine effective apprenticeship programs to improve the competence of pre-service teachers at automotive engineering Vocational High Schools. Therefore, this study aims to determine the development of a Work-Based Learning (WBL)-based industrial apprenticeship model and its effectiveness to improve the competence of pre-service teachers at Vocational High Schools in the field of automotive engineering. This study uses an Education Research and Development (R&D) approach and involves two campuses in Central Java-Indonesia. There were 20 pre-service vocational teachers and three industry parties involved in the preliminary study. The preliminary study aims to obtain information about the problems and needs of the apprenticeship model. Furthermore, there were 60 pre-service vocational teachers and 12 industry parties involved in a follow-up study to test the effectiveness of the apprenticeship model. The sampling technique used is purposive sampling. The study results revealed that the WBL-based industrial apprenticeship model for pre-service vocational teachers in the automotive engineering field was considered feasible. In addition, the implementation of a WBL-based industrial apprenticeship can improve the competence of pre-service automotive engineering teachers, which includes knowledge, attitudes, and skills in the field of automotive engineering. The results of this study have implications for vocational education practitioners, especially higher education that organizes teacher education programs, to apply this apprenticeship model in preparing pre-service vocational teachers. This is because the WBL-based industrial apprenticeship model for pre-service vocational teachers plays a vital role in improving vocational skills for pre-service vocational teachers.

The article deals with the scientific and pedagogical bases of inclusive training of future specialists in the conditions of dual education. The work is based on the idea that the introduction of elements of the dual system of teaching students of pedagogical specialties will contribute to the qualitative development of student's general and inclusive training in the specialty, as well as the acquisition of practical skills in the relevant field directly in the educational organization. The study collected data through an experiment that included128 students and 10 representatives of employers. Data were analyzed using percentages and a pie chart. Results proved that the dual training system as a product of social partnership is an effective and flexible mechanism for training highly qualified specialists who can solve complex production tasks. © 2022 Birlesik Dunya Yenilik Arastirma ve Yayincilik Merkezi.

The article explores how COVID-19, and specifically the lockdown period undergone by Mexico during 2020, affected the transitions of apprentices that completed the MMDT that year. In particular, the article explores whether and to what extent apprentices' aspirations and expectations were readjusted during their transition in times of COVID-19 lockdown. Also, we examine how the MMDT's capacity to provide equal opportunities for all apprentices changed in a context of full disruption of the economic and social life. To explore these themes, we rely on a longitudinal research design consisting of two waves of in-depth interviews with a sample of 52 apprentices in two states of Mexico (Coahuila and State of Mexico). The first wave of interviews took place in 2019 and the second wave in 2020, after apprentices completed the MMDT. Our results suggest it is possible to distinguish at least three distinct transition paths. We find thus a first group of apprentices who readjusted their aspirations by settling for a second-best option to access higher education and/or the labour market; a second group of apprentices with certain economic stability who could afford to stick to their original expectations; and a third group that relied on a delay strategy, by waiting for (education or labour) opportunities to improve and putting their plans on hold. We conclude that apprentices' socioeconomic status operated as a key mediating factor that modulated the opportunities and strategies available to these youngsters in their attempt to adapt and adjust their plans according to the circumstances. These findings shed light on the negative impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the equalizing potential of the MMDT. © 2022 Grupo de Investigacion FORCE.

Practical training at a company and theoretical input at vocational schools for three years lead to a skilled workforce. Among landscaping apprentices plant knowledge receives decreasing attention and seems to deteriorate. The author collaborated with the professional organization within the landscaping sector to identify the reasons behind this trend and possibilities to reverse it. An online survey was administered to 169 landscaping apprentices in two different vocational schools in Bavaria, Germany. Questions addressed motivation and enjoyment with the apprenticeship, methods of learning plant knowledge as well as problems and challenges, and grades in the subject. Most participants were between 15 and 20 years old or older. One third chose the apprenticeship because they liked plants. Two thirds think they have to learn too much plant knowledge. Most apprentices use books, lessons, and nature to learn about plants. They think the subject is important but difficult. Expert interviews were conducted with six experts (trainers, vocational schoolteachers, train-the-trainers, etc.). Questions included the significance of plant knowledge, amount of plants taught, complexity and difficulties of teaching, and teaching methods. Trainers state that plant knowledge is very important for professionals, and that women usually have more plant knowledge than men. They agreed that plant knowledge should not be reduced although it is complex and hard to teach. Specifically, the 5-min-construction-site-method and plant-of-the-week are helpful for trainers. Stories, reduction of details for each single plant, and excursions increase motivation. © 2021 International Society for Horticultural Science.

Previous research has shown that apprenticeship-based high schools (or dual vocational education) increase employment outcomes compared to school-based-only vocational education. Employing a propensity score matching design, we show that apprenticeship’s advantages do not occur at the expense of academic outcomes: apprentices are 0.5 percentage points more likely to graduate on time (p = 0.068) and 3.3 percentage points more likely to access higher education (p = 0.000) than their non-apprentice counterparts.

The goal of this research is to look at what the Malaysian government has done to strengthen industrial involvement in the country's TVET system from 2010 to 2021, as well as to make recommendations for any future changes. A textual narrative synthesis, based on three elements: strategy, execution, and the impact of those policies in promoting industrial involvement in the Malaysian TVET system, was used to conduct a systematic review. Five government policies since 2010 have been extracted from 231 linked-literature sources, each of which presented a strategy to improve industry-TVET cooperation. All of these government measures, according to the report, adopted a corporatist paradigm, in order to encourage corporate participation in the national TVET system. This was done by providing various incentives, including tax breaks, training grants, and subsidies. Improvements have been suggested to boost the industry-TVET relationship in Malaysia, particularly by giving connected industries some obligations to participate in the country's human-resource development, in comparison to the German model of the dual Apprenticeship programme. ©Authors This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0","Dual system; Industrial engagement; Industry-TVET partnership; Malaysian government policy; Malaysian TVET; Technical and vocational education; Vocational education","","","","","","Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education Fundamental Research Grant Scheme, (FRGS/1/2018/SSI09/UPSI/02/20)","This paper was part of a research project entitled “A framework to facilitate and sustain the win-win partnership between industries and training centres;” and it was funded by the 2018 Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education Fundamental Research Grant Scheme.

An over-dependence on the construction and agriculture sectors (used to absorb early school leavers into related apprenticeship programmes) was exposed. Consequently, a reassessment of the challenges this demographic faced informed the development of a suite of targeted responses. This paper reflects on three distinct, although interrelated, areas where strategies which impacted upon NEETs were actioned in Ireland between 2007 and 2019. These are: Formal education; non-formal education and training; and, establishing the voice of those most impacted (i.e., NEETs and potential NEETs), as central to the success of emergent and future responses. © 2021, Publishing House of the Romanian Academy.

Today, the employers expect from educational organizations more than just graduates familiar with industry and having a good theoretical background, but the employees who are able to perform various tasks relating to production, design or organizational issues from the first days of entry on duty. Therefore, the educational process in the engineering university should be organized to ensure the conditions for students to perform certain types of work (professional tryouts) related to future professional activities. It is necessary to develop and build on practical skills and competences in line with the educational program. The student’s professionally oriented activity is viewed as a type of educational and work activity aimed at the professional development of a person achieved though gaining experience in using means and methods of professional activity in the social environment. The basis of this educational process is practice-centered education.

Masonry apprentices are assumed to be healthy, yet may have WMSDs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms (MSS), time loss, and healthcare use among apprentices. 183 brick and block masonry apprentices completed surveys on demographics, work history, MSS, and functional well-being. The prevalence of MSS was calculated by body region, time loss, and healthcare use. The relationship between MSS, and perceived global physical and mental health was assessed. Approximately 78% of apprentices reported MSS, most in several body regions. Low back and wrists/hands were most prevalent, although few missed work or sought healthcare. Lower functional health and well-being was reported. Apprentices reported MSS comparable to previous studies of journey-level masons. Apprenticeship programmes could integrate ergonomics education to help apprentices develop safety culture early in their careers. Practitioner Summary: New masonry workers (apprentices) are assumed to be healthy yet work-related musculoskeletal symptoms (MSS) may be common early in their career. The prevalence of MSS was assessed among apprentices. Approximately 78% of apprentices reported MSS, most in several body regions, comparable to journey-level masons.

Although difficult to analyze directly, we first construct a measure to capture companies’ reactions to changes in academic education rates and second analyze whether academic education rates are associated with success rates in vocational education over time and with control variables. To measure companies’ reactions, we use a cantonal average requirements profile consisting of the academic requirements profile of an occupation and the number of apprenticeships started in this occupation per year and canton. Although results of the first part of the analysis are ambiguous, combined with the second part, they suggest a non-reaction of companies (i.e., they keep offering the same occupations but have to fill their positions with lower-ability candidates). Results of the second part show that more opportunities for academic education appear to draw highly-able students away from vocational education, with negative consequences for the success rates in vocational education. Our findings have important implications for countries with vocational and academic tracks in their education systems, but also for those who plan to introduce or strengthen (dual) vocational education. © 2020, The Author(s).","Academic education; Academic requirements profile in VET; Brain drain; Interplay; Switzerland; Upper-secondary education; Vocational education","","","","","","Economics of Education, Firm Behaviour and Training Policies, (1315000868); Universität Bern, UB; Singapore Eye Research Institute, SERI; Universität Zürich, UZH; Staatssekretariat für Bildung, Forschung und Innovation, SBFI","Funding text 1: This study is funded by the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI) through its Leading House on the Economics of Education, Firm Behaviour and Training Policies (Grant No. 1315000868).

Based on a qualitative study, this article examines the identity strategies of apprentices whose training programs lack prestige. It understands not only identity but also prestige as dynamically and relationally constructed in everyday life and thus empirically contributes to contemporary theoretical debates about occupational prestige. It compares two occupations – bricklaying, which requires lower/medium skills, and automation technology, which requires higher skills – and shows that both are faced with a lack of prestige, although unequally, thus leading the apprentices to employ different strategies to valorize and engage with the training. These strategies draw on the meaning that the apprentices find in their work, the advanced skills the training requires, the variety of work tasks involved and the career possibilities the occupations provide. The results demonstrate that the apprentices are confronted with a vocational-academic divide that exists in many countries. This divide poses a threat to apprentices’ identities, and their strategies aim to either maintain or reverse it. Although the prestige of apprenticeships is related to objective differences between both educational tracks and occupations, social actors can negotiate superiority and inferiority. Thus, the article also provides some practical recommendations for how apprentices confronted with a lack of social recognition can be encouraged to continue engaging with their training. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Automation; Bricklaying; Identity; Occupation; Prestige; Switzerland","","","","","","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF","The study is financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation.

Purpose: This paper outlines undergraduate students' research experiences with palliative care research team at a School of Nursing in rural Appalachia through the Research Apprenticeship Program (RAP). Students engage in research endeavors at the early stage of their education. Methods: Each principal investigator (PI) provided a synopsis of the research project through RAP. RAP staff reviewed all students' applications and notified the PI mentor based on students' research interests. Once students and PIs agree to work together, specific trainings are initiated, including enrolling students in an introductory research course. Findings: Students were engaged in a variety of research related activities. Disruption on research activities during COVID-19 pandemic was also reported and addressed. Discussion: Students shared the benefits and research challenges they experienced.

In the republic, one of the most promising novelties in modern educational technologies is dual education. Since the development of the economy requires an influx of qualified personnel, in recent years the demand for trained and competent specialists has been growing. However, it is not a secret for anyone that the knowledge and business, working skills of the majority of graduates of educational institutions - specialized, higher - do not completely coincide with the real requirements of industries, companies, organizations. As a rule, it requires additional teaching to get the right specialist, which, in turn, takes time and money for additional training, and besides, there are losses in the work process due to the inferiority of the employee. Hence the necessity follows dictated by the life itself, in the process of training future specialists, along with theoretical knowledge, to teach practical skills oriented towards real production and organization It also makes sense to partly orient the theoretical basis of training to a specific production, business process. In fact, we are talking about a kind of symbiosis of theory and practice, for the implementation of which we need different actions. State - for the legislative basis of dual education. Scientific - for the preparation of guidelines for the organization of this form of training. Organizational - for the formation of new target associations, such as research and production centers, various collaborations of educational and industrial, business formations. At the same time, a special role in the implementation of dual technologies is assigned to mentoring young people. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.","","Industrial research; Personnel training; Business Process; Education systems; Educational institutions; Modern educational technologies; Practical skill; Qualified personnel; Radical transformation; Theory and practice; Knowledge management","","","","","","","Verbitsky A.A., The Education and Science Journal, 6, pp. 5-18, (2012); Ulyanina O.A., Psychological and Pedagogical Research, 10, 2, pp. 135-147, (2018); Sudhoff M., Prinz C., Kuhlenkotter B., Procedia Manufacturing, 45, pp. 114-120, (2020); Abdiraiymova G., Duisenova S., Shayakhmetov S., Procedia -Social and Behavioral Sciences, 116, pp. 4315-4321, (2014); Abdiraiymova G., Duisenova S., Shayakhmetov S., Procedia -Social and Behavioral Sciences, 8, pp. 397-403, (2013); Beissenova A., Shormanbayeva D., Sundetbayev D., Procedia -Social and Behavioral Sciences, 140, pp. 168-171, (2014); Shormanbayeva D., Abdigaliyeva G., Karassartova M., Sivodedova A., Balshikeyeyv S., Procedia -Social and Behavioral Sciences, 114, pp. 574-578, (2014); Shatskaya I.V., Kreativnaya Ekonomika, 12, 3, pp. 305-314, (2018); Kaufman N.Y., Kreativnaya Ekonomika, 12, 3, pp. 261-270, (2018); Myrkhalykova Z., Aidarovab A., Seidahmetovc M., Abishovad A., Dosmuratova E., Procedia -Social and Behavioral Sciences, 143, pp. 491-496, (2014); Gambeeva Y.N., Sorokina E.I., Kreativnaya Ekonomika, 12, 3, pp. 285-304, (2018); Kenzhebayev G.K., Dalayeva T.T., Procedia -Social and Behavioral Sciences, 152, pp. 179-183, (2014); Koudahl P.D., Procedia -Social and Behavioral Sciences, 9, pp. 1900-1905, (2010); Wiesner S., Horizonte B., Energy Procedia, 57, pp. 1034-1036, (2014); Li R., Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience, 2, pp. 91-98, (2017); Ana Del Carmen Tolino Fernández-Henarejos, Ma Ángeles Hernández-Prados, Procedia -Social and Behavioral Sciences, 237, pp. 1026-1031, (2017); Anckaert P.-E., Cassiman D., Cassiman B., Research Policy, 49, 2, (2020); Shulruf B., Turner R., Hattie J., Procedia -Social and Behavioral Sciences, 1, 1, (2009); Beddewela E., Long Range Planning, 52, 6, (2019); Musil B., Musek J., Rus V.S., Studia Psychologica, 51, 1, pp. 53-68, (2009); Yermentayeva A., Naimanbaieva K., Sultanbayevac L., Uaidullakyzydd E., Niyetbayeva G., Procedia -Social and Behavioral Sciences, 82, pp. 904-907, (2013)","Z.

This article reviews the diversity of collective skill formation systems with a particular focus on their systemic governance. In particular, we look at the actors involved as well as how the systemic governance is organised in terms of corporatist decision-making bodies. The article shows that there are important cross-national differences. First, the social partners do not always participate in the decision-making at the political-strategic level. Second, social partner involvement is not always on equal terms (parity), with trade unions in some cases being less strongly involved. Third, differences in VET governance are particularly pronounced at the technical-operational level.

In this respect, the implementation of the circular economy model, which requires engineers to acquire appropriate competencies, enabling companies to establish this model at the manufacturing level. Moreover, competence has always been a priority for both the professional and the company. In this sense, connectivism has been called a learning theory for the digital era; this is the reason why a review of the state-of-the-art developments of this paradigm focused on engineering has been carried out. In this sense, the potential of the digital transformation in instruction to formulate an engineering model based on neuro-competences is of great interest, taking the connectivist paradigm as a methodological axis. To this end, a first bibliometric analysis has been carried out to identify the drivers on which to base the design of the neuro-competencies of the instructional engineering environment and the trend towards curriculum development under dual training models. The bibliographical research carried out on the connectivist paradigm has served to identify the trends followed to date in education within the subject area of engineering. These trends have not fully taken into account the leading role of the human factor within the socio-technical cyber-physical systems of sustainable manufacturing (SCSSM). The focus was more on the technology than on the adaptation of the uniqueness of the human factor and the tasks entrusted to him, which entails an additional complexity that needs to be addressed in both academic and professional contexts. In light of the foregoing, an improvement to the acquisition and management of competencies has been proposed to the academic, professional and dual engineering contexts. It is based on the transversal inclusion of the concept of neuro-competence applied to the competence engineering (CE) model, transforming it into the neuro-competence engineering (NCE) model. The foregoing provides a better match between the characteristics of the human factor and the uniqueness of the tasks performed by the engineer, incorporating activity theory (AT), the law of variety required (LVR), the connectivist paradigm and neuroscience as a transversal driver of innovation through fractality. This proposal enables a ubiquitous and sustainable learning model throughout the entire academic and professional life cycle of the engineer, placing it sustainably at the heart of the instructional and professional cyber-physical socio-technical system, thus complying with the SDGs set by the UN and Horizon 2030. © 2021 by the authors.

The material resources available in research apprenticeships—such as research equipment, field gear, etc.—may be particularly consequential for building identification with science, as they are abundant and frequently hold disciplinary authenticity. However, most sociocultural studies of research apprenticeships have focused on cognitive-ideational or social aspects rather than on the material aspects of the learning setting. This paper investigates the association between different types of science-related material resources in the context of a geoscience and biology-focused research apprenticeship program for girls. The study employed a qualitative approach, drawing on theoretical constructs of communities of practice, identity resources, and identity work to inform program design and analysis. Our findings highlight specific ways that instruments, specialized clothing, specimens, artifacts, and physical settings of science intersect with science-related affect, science learning, and a sense of “feeling like a scientist.” The results imply that practitioners both in and out of the classroom should privilege agentic use of tools when working with all learners, but especially girls. Further, the types of material resources selected in learning settings are critically important, as different types of material resources afford different types of identity work. In particular, using materials that hold disciplinary authenticity, when coupled with learning about how scientists use those same instruments, helps girls “feel like scientists,” an important part of becoming a science apprentice. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Previous studies commonly do not go beyond descriptive analyzes of a single group of actors, mostly trainees. The few multi-perspective findings indicate that quality assessments by trainees and trainers sometimes differ widely. In this article, this finding is confirmed at the group level by using survey data (311 trainees, 30 trainers). In addition, the potential significance of the perspective taken for the modeling of links between different quality dimensions is checked. Here, bilateral modeling of training quality, which considers differences in perception between trainees and trainers, correlates significantly more strongly with trainees’ drop-out intentions than their unilateral quality assessment. Additionally, it is shown that certain trainee characteristics can partly explain differences in the assessment of training quality by different actors. Overall, the findings underline the relevance of multi-perspective approaches when considering the quality of training. © 2021, The Author(s).","Differences in perception; Drop-out; Drop-out intention; Dual vocational education and training (VET); Training quality","","","","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG; Universität Mannheim, UMA","","Aarkrog V., Wahlgren B., Larsen C.H., Mariager-Anderson K., Gottlieb S., Decision-making processes among potential dropouts in vocational education and training and adult learning, International Journal for Research in Vocational Education and Training, 5, 2, pp. 111-129, (2018); Bildung in Deutschland 2012.

Integration of ESD in Vocational Education and Training (VET) offers opportunities for private sector actors to contribute to reaching these global goals. The dual structure of businessintegrated training in Germany further exemplifies a business case and the numerous opportunities available to private companies for engaging with the SDG framework. This briefing paper highlighted available evidence from the ESD literature on VET skills development in advancing the SDGs. Outcomes from best practices were based on the tried-and-tested länder—federal states—piloted vocational training of the Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training (BIBB) INEBB1 project (INEBB), demonstrating the conditions necessary for vocational education training in sustainability and plausible transfer mechanism within companies. These conditions included (1) the application of deductive concepts, (2) the establishment of blended-learning platforms (place-based and digital), and (3) the adaptation of the criteria and contents from the German Sustainability Codex (DNK) in curriculums designed for the training. This innovative vocational course and certification as specialist training for sustainable development was a model case in bringing the SDGs closer to German companies’ vocational education. INEBB2 sought to upscale applicable and task-based instructions from the experimented model project INEBB1 within different companies through regional, lateral, and vertical transfer strands. The INEBB project model in the review suggested there was a need for further empirical work and policy discourse on educational transfer research in the framework of VET for sustainable development. The INEBB project model integrated the new standard occupational profile items of the environmental protection and the sustainability and digitalised world of work across occupational competencies in the German dual system of vocational education and training that will come into force in August 2021 for all 326 dual training professions. © 2021 by the authors.

Persistently high unemployment, particularly among the youth, is a concern in many countries. Against this background, this article conducts empirical tests on youth employment and unemployment in OECD countries and EU Member States for the period 2000-2017. This article shows that high rates of youth unemployment in many developed countries can be attributed to the structural and institutional factors of youth labor markets as well as the economic crisis. Countries with less duality in labor market and more work–study programs display relatively higher levels of youth employment and lower unemployment in unfavorable economic conditions. This finding suggests that a high youth unemployment rate does not have to be attributed exclusively to the economic crisis and that there is room for improvement by designing a more effective youth labor policy. © 2021","Business Cycle; Dual Education; Labor Market; Unemployment; Youth Employment","","","","","","Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, HUFS","* This article was developed from author’s previous research (Korean version) ‘Employment Policies in Low Growth Period: Case Studies and Empirical Analyses on European Countries’.

We provide outcome data for un-ruptured aneurysm patients treated at a European hybrid center to prove that hybrid neurosurgeons achieve clinical and angiographical results allowing to integrate hybrid neurosurgery into routine aneurysm treatment. This will not only help to maintain neurovascular microsurgical skills but will influence staff costs in related hospitals. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed all consecutively treated un-ruptured aneurysm patients between 2000 and 2016. The decision-making took into account the pros and cons of both modalities and considered patient and aneurysm characteristics. Clinical outcome was assessed by the modified Rankin scale (mRS). Occlusion rates were stratified into grade I for 100%, grade II for 99–90%, and grade III for <90% occlusion. To account for the introduction of stents, two treatment periods (p1, 2000 to 2008; p2, 2009 to 2016) were defined. Results: The study population consisted of 274 patients (median age 55 years) harboring 338 un-ruptured aneurysms. Microsurgery (MS) was performed in 51.8% and endovascular therapy (EVT) in 43.1%; 5.1% required combined treatment. Overall, 93% showed a favorable clinical outcome (mRS 0–2), 94.3% after MS and 91.5% after EVT. Grade I aneurysm occlusion was achieved in 82.6% patients, 91.9% after MS and 72.9% after EVT. Procedure-related complications occurred after MS in 5.6% and after EVT in 4.4% patients. Mortality was recorded for five (1.8%) patients, one patient after MS and four after EVT. For the EVT cohort, significant improvement from p1 to p2 was seen with clinical outcomes (P=0.030, RR = 0.905, CI: 0.8351–0.9802) and occlusion rates (P=0.039, RR = 0.6790, CI: 0.499–0.923). Conclusion: Hybrid neurosurgeons achieve qualified clinical and angiographic results. Dual training will allow to maintain neurovascular caseloads and preserve future aneurysm treatment within neurosurgery. Furthermore economic benefits could be observed in hospital management. © 2021, The Author(s).","Embolization; Hospital economy; Hybrid neurosurgery; Microsurgery; Outcome; Un-ruptured intracranial aneurysm","Adult;

Additionally, the interdisciplinary nature of UX may make a consensus on teaching pedagogies and methods difficult to reach. To add to the complexity of teaching UX, is the emergence of the degree apprenticeship programme where apprentices study at a higher education university for 20% of their time while 80% is spent with their employer. This paper describes the process of launching a programme to respond to this unique and emerging context during a global pandemic. It focuses on reflections from lecturers on the challenges and reception of the programme and discusses the initial contributions this work can bring to conceptions of UX pedagogies, especially those delivered in an online delivery environment. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Curriculum delivery; Education; Teaching; User experience","","","","","","School of Digital Arts; Manchester Metropolitan University, MMU","The authors would like to thank Manchester Metropolitan University and the School of Digital Arts (SODA), the Apprenticeship Unit, the employers and their apprentices on the Digital User Experience Degree Apprenticeship.","Getto G., Potts L., Salvo M.J., Gossett K., Teaching UX: Designing programs to train the next generation of UX experts, ACM International.

Design/methodology/approach: This is a descriptive case study narrative about one programme from one HEI, selected for its relevance for the subject area of apprenticeships. This descriptive approach allows the provision of apprenticeships within HEI to be explored in depth by one institution. Findings: This case study identifies the considerable value of apprenticeships within HEI for the students, the employers and the HEI. It also identifies that there are challenges within this. These findings will be of interest to those entering into the apprenticeship arena, especially within healthcare, and may inform an academic discourse in this area. Research limitations/implications: It is acknowledged that this case study does not seek to compare apprenticeships with other programmes.

The first section discusses the relevance of training policy with regard to economic competitiveness and social inclusion. Subsequently, the chapter explores the literature on varieties of capitalism and skill formation regimes, before zooming in on collective skill formation systems because of their particularly interesting form of private-public partnership in the case of dual vocational education and training. This chapter then turns to structural pressures on skill formation regimes, most notably globalization and technological change. The final section discusses how skill formation regimes, especially European systems with private-public partnerships as in collective skill formation regimes, can survive in the face of these structural pressures. It finds that while some collective elements are increasingly transferred to other regimes, collective systems themselves have been subject to declining collectivism. Either the state takes over functions of employers or training is increasingly shaped according to the demands of (large) firms. © Aynsley Kellow, Tony Porter and Karsten Ronit 2021.","","","","","","","","","Acemoglu D., Pischke J.S., Why Do Firms Train?

One promising intervention is teaching adolescents how to cook healthy meals. The Los Angeles Trust for Children’s Health partnered with The Los Angeles Neighborhood Land Trust to integrate nutrition education and hands-on cooking demonstrations into an after-school program called the Gardening Apprenticeship Program at a local high school. Designed as a yearlong intervention, the Gardening Apprenticeship Program involves garden-based activities teaching food and environmental justice. Cultivating partnerships with other community-based organizations can help build capacity to pilot and replicate similar programs in other communities in food deserts. © 2020 Society for Public Health Education.","adolescent health; community intervention; food justice; health education; nutrition; partnerships","Adolescent; Child; Cooking; Gardening; Health Education; Health Promotion; Humans; Schools; United States; adolescent; child; cooking; gardening; health education; health promotion; human; school; United States","","","","","California’s CalFresh Healthy Living Program; U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA; California Department of Public Health, CDPH; Agricultural Research Service, USDA ARS, ARS; Economic Research Service, ERS","We are grateful for the partnership with The Los Angeles Neighborhood Land Trust and appreciate the students’ participation in the nutrition education and cooking workshops.

The combined theoretical and empirical perspective demonstrates how this form of corporate social responsibility (CSR) depends on the structural characteristics of companies and organizations. Additionally, it is a discussion about how involvement in apprenticeship programs depends on systems of established formal and informal rules operating on different spatial scales that are formed and played out in a regional context. From a management perspective, education–workplace collaborations may depend on the robustness of organizational capacity and the ability to be involved over a long period. Thus, it is important not only to discuss motivation and performance from the viewpoint of the individual firm but also to understand the effects of multitude of players in the way their vocational education training (VET) tasks coexist, set a standard, compete, or form collective actions. The empirical evidence is based on a recent study of workplaces’ engagement in VET in cooperation with the three senior high schools in the Nordhordland region in Western Norway. The data collection, conducted in 2018, was based on a mixed-methods approach. It combined register data on occupation, education, and apprenticeships with primary data from 93 qualitative interviews with a sample of representatives of companies and public sector institutions, as well as nine focus group interviews with representatives from schools, regional stakeholders, and local/regional administrative offices concerned with collaboration between senior high schools, businesses, and other types of workplaces. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","","","","","","","","Aras G., Crowther D., A handbook of corporate governance and social responsibility, Corporate Social Responsibilities Series, (2010); Bengtsson B., Hertting N., Generalization by mechanism: Thin rationality and ideal-type analysis in case study research, Philosophy of Social Sciences, 44, 6, pp. 707-732, (2014); Busemeyer M.R., Trampusch C., The Comparative Political Economy of Collective Skill Formation, pp. 3-38, (2012); Spotlight on VET Norway (Report in Cedefop Information Series).

Although the waiter, the cook, and the chef, the bartender, and the sommelier have different approaches to wine due to their duties, there are many overlapping areas of knowledge and practical skills, which must be included in training programs. We suggest that in Hungary the Portuguese model should be followed as an education technique in the HORECA industry. Thus, theoretical and practical training should take place in regional centers, with student dormitories, and public restaurants.

In countries with a dual education system (e.g., Germany, Austria, Switzerland) adolescents as young as 14 or 15 have to come up with career decisions and to apply for an apprenticeship (combining training at the workplace with part-time education in a vocational school). Theories on career orientation would regard this age as very early for solid decisions which take personal interests and abilities into consideration rather than social expectations or stereotypes. Even though these young adolescents need support, career counselling and support measures offered by schools and other institutions leave a lot to be desired. Consequently, the problems are manifold: insecurities in career decisions, gender-stereotyped decisions, or dropouts. Many of these problems concern occupations in STEM branches. The present perspective paper pursues the following aims: • to highlight the specific difficulties of young adolescents facing such early decisions, • to investigate reasons why few girls consider an apprenticeship in STEM branches, • to discuss perspectives on how to support these adolescents for well-grounded career decisions based on Gottfredson's Theory of Circumscription and Compromise that are not influenced by gender stereotypes or by biased advice of parents, teachers, peers, and others. © 2021 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Apprenticeship; Career choice; Career counselling; Gender; Gender stereotypes; Interest; STEM","","","","","","","","Archam S., Brauchart M., Dorner T., Grimm A., Luck M., Nemet M., Steiner J., Statistical guide: Key facts and figures about schools and adult education in Austria, (2011); Beicht U., Walden G., Duale Berufsausbildung ohne Abschluss: Ursachen und weiterer bildungsbiografischer Verlauf, BIBB Report, 7, 21, pp. 1-15, (2013); Blanchard C.A., Lichtenberg J.W., Compromise in career decision making: A test of Gottfredson's theory, Journal of Vocational Behavior, 62, 2, pp. 250-271, (2003); The Austrian education system, (2018); Berufsbildungsbericht 2018, (2018); Decker D., Student Perceptions of Higher Education and Apprenticeship Alignment, Educ.

Information collected during a sociological survey in four Ural monotowns—Krasnoturyinsk, Pervouralsk, Revda (Sverdlovsk Oblast) and Dalmatovo (Kurgan Oblast) — was used as empirical data for the study. Education can sometimes work “against” the community, as cultural and symbolic capital that young people acquire at secondary or sometimes vocational schools allows them to migrate from their hometowns to larger cities for education purposes. Therefore, better-educated youths are more likely to leave monotowns. At the same time, availability of educational institutions in a monotown provides its citizens with opportunities for personal growth as well as improvement of urban environment. A way out of this seemingly insoluble dilemma could be the policy of civic engagement, which can be implemented provided there are diverse labor market opportunities and a conducive social infrastructure. Planning the cooperation among businesses, education and municipal authorities should be part of the town development strategy, not only the result of decisions handed down by some ministries. The article also offers an example of a cultural life script: a life story of a respondent whose desire to stay in a small town was only increased by the education she obtained. © 2021.

Materials & Methods: This was action research performed by Kemmis and McTaggart approach in four academic semesters during 2019-2020 at Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences. In total, 48 third and fourth-year radiographytechnology students, as well as the department chairman and two educators were enrolled in the study. Individual semi-structured interviews were made with the subjects with a focus on the identification of problems and presenting solutions. In addition, data were analyzed by a conventional content analysis method. The proposed strategies were exploited in the implementation stage and the effectiveness of the program was assessed by individual interviews and group sessions. Results: The planning stage findings demonstrated that improper design and organization of apprenticeship programs, incompatibility of clinical courses with theory courses, inefficient training in the hospital, inadequate summative evaluation, and lack of welfare facilities in the hospital were regarded as barriers to clinical learning of students. Following determining and classification of issues, measures were taken in the implementation stage in cooperation with the educational authorities of the faculty and clinic to achieve goals in this field. In addition, observation and reflection results confirmed students’ satisfaction with early return measures. Conclusion: The participation of clinical education experts and radiographytechnology students led to a more accurate understanding of problems of clinical education and examining possible solutions to improve the situation. Students were clearly satisfied with the changes made in the implementation stage. Overall, students had a positive reaction for being a member of the planning group to eliminate their education problems. © 2021, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences and Health Services.

Theoretical accounts of ‘boundary crossing’ have explored how vocational teachers can integrate learning across domains by drawing on extended concepts and theoretical knowledge to solve workplace problems; whilst empirical accounts have validated the role of vocational educators by describing the workplace and schools as equally valid, complementary spheres. Different understandings, described here as ‘integrative’, ‘complementary’ and ‘implicit’, appear to reflect different national patterns of vocational education. The paper reports a qualitative study conducted around two case studies, located in Germany and England, of the way vocational teachers’ understandings of facilitating learning across domains are constructed. Vocational teachers working in Germany’s ‘dual training’ claimed to provide advanced knowledge that they compared to practical work skills, reflecting ‘implicit’ or ‘complementary’ approaches to learning across domains. Teachers in England, where workplace learning elements are more unevenly developed and lack institutional foundations, nevertheless described colleges and workplaces as distinctive, little-connected spheres. These differences suggest that teachers’ approaches are less shaped by the potential or necessity for ‘integrative’ approaches than by the way different systems enable or constrain their conceptualisation of ‘possible futures’. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","boundary crossing; dual training; T Levels; vocational education and training (VET); vocational teachers; Workplace learning","","","","","","","","Aarkrog V., Learning in the Workplace and the Significance of School-Based Education: A Study of Learning in a Danish Vocational Education and Training Programme, International Journal of Lifelong Education, 24, 2, pp. 137-147, (2005); Akkerman S.F., Bakker A., Boundary Crossing and Boundary Objects, Review of Educational Research, 81, 2, pp. 132-169, (2011); Bank V., Connectivity or Complementarity?

These efforts involve on one hand the design of an extremely experimental degree and on the other hand, the engagement of local companies that must collaborate in a rigorous way with the teaching of the students, since they must give a number of lessons of specific subjects to the hosted students. In this paper, authors describe the implantation process of the Bachelor’s Degree in Automotive Engineering at the Faculty of Engineering Vitoria-Gasteiz of the University of the Basque Country (Spain). In the paper the accreditation process carried out in the Basque University System Quality Agency (UNIBASQ) is described, giving some ideas about the information provided for all the points that that were fulfilled to gain the “dual training” accreditation of the agency. This information could be used by other university faculties to be aware and to plan a dual version of any Bachelor’s degree in Engineering. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","Accreditation; Company; Dual training; Quality; University","Accreditation; Students; Accreditation process; Basque Country; Implantation process; University system; Engineering education","","","","","AIRJET, (KK-2018/00109); Regional Development Agency of the Basque Country; Steadman Philippon Research Institute, SPRI","The Regional Development Agency of the Basque Country (SPRI) is gratefully acknowledged for economic support through the research project “Refrigeración de dispositivos de alto flujo térmico mediante impacto de chorro” (AIRJET), KK-2018/00109, Programa ELKARTEK.","Vilalta J.M., ¿Es posible (y deseable) la formación universitaria dual?, Blog de Studia XXI, (2017); Asociación Catalana de Universidades Públicas Universitat de Lleida, (2015); Unibasq: Protocolo para la obtención del reconocimiento de formación dual para títulos universitarios oficiales de grado y máster, (2017); Fundación Bertelsmann: Guía básica sobre la formación profesional dual, (2014); Rego Agraso L., Barreira Cerqueiras E.M., Rial Sanchez A.F., Formación profesional dual: comparativa entre el sistema alemán y el incipiente modelo español, Revista Española de Educación Comparada, 25, pp. 149-166, (2015); Dual Training: Guía metodológica alumnos formación profesional dual, (2015); Duran Lopez P., Santos Primo J.R., Gil Perez R., Guía de la formación dual.

However, the coordination of labour market demand and the supply of skill requires either well-functioning labour market institutions or institutionally embedded strategic partnerships among government, labour and employers. In particular, the transplantation of German-style dual education methods to a different environment poses significant institutional dilemmas. Russia presents a useful case for examining the conditions under which such arrangements can be established. Based on a series of interviews in six Russian regions and a set of case histories, we seek to draw testable hypotheses that can be applied to other settings. © 2020 University of Glasgow.","","Russian Federation; labor market; reform process; skilled labor; vocational education","","","","","Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (161810425); National Research University Higher School of Economics, ВШЭ","This article was prepared within the framework of the Basic Research Program at the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE) and was supported within the framework of a subsidy by the Russian Academic Excellence Project ‘5-100’.

Apprenticeships have long been acknowledged as a practical vehicle to develop the vocational skills and educational achievements of the UK employee resource. The UK Government set a target of 3 million apprenticeship starts between 2015 and 2020. In order for higher education institutions (HEI) to participate in the new apprenticeship marketplace, they need to consider distinct factors that do not surface in traditional Bachelors programmes. Cognizant of these challenges this paper evaluates the development of the new degree apprenticeship programmes for built environment education through the research lens of HEI. This paper evaluates extant literature and primary data collected from qualitative interviews carried out across the UK HEI sector during 2017. Research findings are presented following analysis using NVivo. Narratives on the barriers, benefits, and opportunities, of degree apprenticeships, including academic quality assurance, governance, and pedagogic dimensions are presented. The findings include industry designed curriculum producing a different graduate output, redefining the purpose of HE, restructuring governance and resource, additional contractual obligations for stakeholders and the embedding of work-based learning strategies. © 2019, © 2019 Associated Schools of Construction.","barriers; benefits; built environment; Degree apprenticeships","","","","","","Council of Heads of the Built Environment"," It is with sincere thanks and appreciation that the authors acknowledge the sponsorship they received from the Council of Heads of the Built Environment to support this study.

The EU itself has actively promoted the benefits of dual VET to its members, offering financial and organisational support for the introduction of apprenticeships into the formal educational systems. However, while dual VET is widely considered to be a valuable tool for easing the transition into the labour market for young people, it is also a form of skill formation that requires a lot of coordination not only between the schools and firms that carry out the training, but also among the firms themselves and between employer and employee organisations. In this introduction we argue that whereas the EU has been successful in encouraging establishment of dual VET in all its member countries, its implementation has been very uneven. This is due in part to the pre-existing differences in the underlying organisational structures, but also to the ongoing demographic, technological, and institutional changes – some caused by European integration itself – which weaken firms’ incentives to train. © The Author(s) 2020.","apprenticeships; collective skill formation; dual VET; EU education policy; labour market transition; trade unions","","","","","","","","Acemoglu D., Pischke J.-S., Why do firms train?

Many countries in Asia and Africa face skill gaps in different productive sectors of economy. Education, skill development, on-the-job training, etc., are crucial components of human resource development. Africa has witnessed significant economic growth in recent years, but its growth process is impaired by lack of skills and emigration of skilled workforce to other regions of the world. Almost half of Africa’s population is below the age of 25 years, and the skill gap could change this demographic dividend into a demographic drag. As India and other Asian countries are also facing similar challenges, there is a scope for sharing experiences particularly between India and African countries with respect to human resource development. Very often, the programmes run by governments in Africa to address skill gaps are plagued by slow implementation and related issues. Among Asian countries, India and Japan have considerable experience in skill development and capacity building. In the last two decades, the Indian private sector has also been engaged in skill building. Under AAGC, India and Japan could share their expertise in human resources in different industrial sectors with their African counterparts to develop a local skilled workforce for industrial development in Africa. Skill development programmes may include apprenticeship programmes by Indian and Japanese firms operating in Africa, skill upgradation of women and disadvantaged sections by NGOs and reviving formal education system through universities in Africa, among others. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","","","","","","","","","Amadou S., Jobless Growth in Sub-Saharan Africa, Africa in Focus, (2014); Biavaschi C., Eichhorst W., Giulietti C., Kendzia M.J., Zimmermann K.F., Muravyev A., Et al., Youth Unemployment and Vocational Training, (2012); Curtain R., Skill formation in Japan: The broader context and recent developments, labour and industry, A Journal of the Social and Economic Relations of Work, 6, 1, pp. 67-88, (1994); I’m the Change: Parables from a Developing World, (2017); Macarthur J., Routman B., Youth Unemployment in Sub-Saharan Africa: Varying Solutions to Complex Problems, (2014)","M.

A key challenge for part-time programs is adequately supporting students in connecting their learning within the program to their work life, which in contrast to dual education is not part of the program. To better understand such boundary-crossing support in part-time higher professional education, this explanatory sequential mixed-methods study was conducted. A large-scale study, consisting of quantitative data analysis of the Dutch National Student Survey, confirmed that part-time programs (n = 600) differ in perceived boundary crossing, with a medium effect size of η2 =.13, and that factors postulated in the literature are related. An in-depth cross-case analysis of the boundary-crossing support provided in four purposefully selected part-time higher education programs (with high and low perceived support) indicated that brokers, boundary objects, hybrid practices, boundary interactions, degrees of freedom, degrees of clarity, and supervision are ways to support boundary crossing. These findings provide actionable strategies by which part-time higher professional education programs can support student learning across contexts. © 2019, The Author(s).","Boundary crossing; Higher professional education; Learning across contexts; Mixed-methods; Part-time education","","","","","","Universiteit Utrecht, UU","","Adviesrapport Flexibel hoger onderwijs voor volwassenen, (2014); Akkerman S., Admiraal W., Brekelmans M., Oost H., Auditing quality of research in social sciences, Quality & Quantity, 42, 2, pp. 257-274, (2008); Akkerman S.F., Bakker A., Crossing boundaries between school and work during apprenticeships, Vocations and Learning, 5, 2, pp. 153-173, (2012); Akkerman S.F., Bakker A., Boundary crossing and boundary objects, Review of Educational Research, 81, 2, pp. 132-169, (2011); Alexander K., Bozick R., Entwisle D., Warming up, cooling out, or holding steady?

Design/methodology/approach: Using a qualitative case study approach, the authors interviewed the members of the organisation to gain insights into opportunities and challenges they faced in addressing their skills needs. Findings: The analysis showed that the collaboration and commitment of stakeholders were essential to the success of the programme. Furthermore, flexibility in employer’s expectations to allow for career progression was critical to motivating students to continue in the programme. A positive impact of the programme on overall employee morale and organisational culture was revealed. Research limitations/implications: Although the findings may be relevant to other similar organisations, they may have limitations in their applicability to other contexts. Practical implications: The study holds promise for the field of human resource development, as practitioners and scholars can benefit from the renewed interest in youth apprenticeship to identify how their activities within and outside of the organisation can build and retain the human capacity needed for organisational performance and competitiveness. Originality/value: Employer–education partnerships have been touted as a solution to the skills gaps in industries. However, there is very little literature on employer-initiated apprenticeships focused on youth in the USA.

M. Beketov National University of Urban Economy. The current article introduces the scientific community with the re-sults of reengineering at the department, which made it possible to implement certain conceptual and funda-mental provisions of the dual, digital, and cluster approaches in the development of education. The problem, which resolves the contradiction between the standardization of learning processes by traditional methods and innovative learning processes based on the use of intelligent information technologies, is devised. Based on the analysis of the tendencies in the development of pedagogy methodology, it was concluded that today the methodological paradigms in the science of teaching and the formation of a new methodological paradigm of educology were changed. Cybernetic pedagogy, which combines methods of traditional pedagogy and cyber-netics, has had a significant impact on the formation of educalogy. This combination of methods created a support system for the educational processes of the department. The basic theoretical decisions of the depart-ment reengineering and results of experimental research conducted based on a support system of educational processes of the department are shown in the article. The results of two full-scale experiments are presented. The purpose of the first experiment was to evaluate the possibility of independent study of science-intensive educational material in the discipline ""Mathematical processing of geodetic measurements,"" and for the sec-ond – to evaluate the possibility of creating an intellectual property exchange of scientific-pedagogical and pedagogical workers. Besides, the results of the experimental studies allowed to creation of innovative author-ing training technology ""Partnership,"" which provides for participating students in the formation of educa-tional material (tutorials). From the above, it is possible to conclude about the effectiveness of reengineering procedures in the concept of dual and digital education. © К. O. Meteshkin, О. I. Morozova, O. Ye.

As the analysis of the TVET system in Kazakhstan presented in the article shows, different forms of cooperation between participants of the educational process in the country (corporate partnership, industrial clusters, patronage of large and medium-sized enterprises over educational institutions, etc.) contribute to the development of a market-oriented education system. Monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of technical and vocational education, as well as identifying opportunities to improve its quality and scope require understanding of its nature, its functions, goals and key characteristics, the application of effective scientific tools to assess vocational technical education and training of trainers (tutors) (TVET). The paper shows that the success of the transfer of educational programs depends primarily on the willingness to work together of all the stakeholders, the creation of systematic structures of interaction in the development of educational programs of different levels, improving methods of forecasting demand not only for certain professions, but also for professional and pre-professional competencies. The purpose of scientific evaluation of the dual system and workplace training is to prove its effectiveness as an educational strategy that provides students with real work experience, where they can apply social and technical skills and develop them. © 2021 Moscow Polytechnic University.

Teaching could obviously not be an exception but is quite the opposite because of its role in training the individuals of that society. Teachers at all levels of education are subjected to an adaptation process to develop the digital skills necessary for this transformation. This process must be permanent as there are still major deficiencies in teachers’ ICT knowledge and rejection of their application. This study aims to see whether the inadequacy of digital teaching skills also occurs in the Dual Vocational Training modality. To this end, a descriptive quantitative method has been carried out in a sample of teachers from the Professional Formation Dual system in the Autonomous Community of Andalusia. The results show an insufficient level of digital skills that is therefore improvable, finding some factors that influence, to some extent, the various components of digital competence such as prior teacher training, the locality in which their school resides or the category of teaching to which he belongs. Therefore, it is advised to continue to promote in-service training in digital competence for in-service teachers in order to achieve sustainable educational development. © 2021 by the authors.

We examine the outcomes and targeting using counterfactual impact evaluation (quasi-experimental design) of the apprenticeship program on the basis of administrative data from the Czech Employment Office. The implementation strategy is analyzed using various policy documents. The findings indicate that the program is apparently targeted at those groups of young people who are less disadvantaged as regards education level and previous unemployment experience. At the same time, paradoxically, the effects in terms of outflows from the unemployment register are weak for the short-term and medium-term unemployed, as well as for low-skilled and high-skilled youth, and stronger effects are evident in the case of long-term unemployed and medium-skilled youth. The failures in targeting and in adjusting the program to the needs of more vulnerable groups of youth are due to an inconsistent implementation strategy of Czech Public Employment Services. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","active labor market policies; apprenticeship program","Czech Republic; educational attainment; implementation process; labor market; labor policy; young population","","","","","EU Horizon project NEGOTIATE, (649395, OPZ/14/122/0006089)","The research on which the paper builds was supported by the EU Horizon project NEGOTIATE (Negotiating early job insecurities in Europe, Grant agreement number 649395) and by Czech Operational Program Employment project Effectiveness and efficiency of active labour market policy measures, grant no OPZ/14/122/0006089.

This has become popular in tertiary education. Many research studies have shown its benefits and discussed the favorable effects, especially with respect to L2 language gains. Yet, critical voices, also from the primary stakeholders, namely the students taking part in such integrated programs, have also been heard. In an effort to integrate into the international academic and scientific community, universities in Vietnam have also started to teach academic courses in English. The main objective of this cross-sectional survey study (N=104) was to explore Vietnamese students' perceptions of such dual-training programs and to investigate to what extent they feel the program currently meets their needs. Our findings show that both lecturers and students are struggling in these courses, for one thing, because of insufficient levels of mastery of the English language; while for another reason, since courses cannot be characterized as courses in which disciplinary contents and the foreign language are taught in an integrated way. The way forward seems to be to educate the lecturers and the students well, before allowing them to participate in CLIL English courses. All these issues need to be considered in the context of local Vietnamese educational realities and traditions. ©Authors This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0","Content- and language-integrated learning (CLIL); English-Medium instruction (EMI); Students' perception; Survey; Vietnamese higher education","","","","","","","","Aguilar M., Rodriguez R., Lecturer and student perceptions on CLIL at a Spanish university, International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism, 15, 2, pp. 183-197, (2012); Coyle D., Hood P., Marsh D., Content and Language Integrated Learning, (2010); Do H.

VET reforms–during the 20 years before the Second World War and after 1945–were carried out to support rising industry and other developing areas of the economy. Recent reforms (passed in 2015 and 2017) strengthen significantly the meaning of the dual character of vocational education in Poland. This article presents Polish data from the international project ‘Improving Expertise on Labour Relations’ Impact on Youth Employability in Central and South-Eastern Europe’ (EaSI grant VS/2016/0104). The research concerned the improvement of vocational education and the employability of students and young workers, especially regarding the idea and practice of dual VET education. The data were gathered using individual semi-structured and focus group interviews. The use of SWOT analysis has highlighted the multilevel nature of the VET learning environment and its advantages and disadvantages perceived from the perspective of many stakeholders–school representatives, employers and also students. The central question of the analysis is about the possible pathways of changes that could improve the existing system. © 2021 The Vocational Aspect of Education Ltd.","Dual vocational education; learning environment; multi-perspective approach; reform dynamics","","","","","","","","Adamski W., Baethge M., Bertrand O., Grootgings P., Jozefowicz A., Edukacja W Okresie Transformacji.

This paper categorizes occupational training in lower, middle, and higher segments and investigates the influence of these segments on the probability of overqualification, i.e. working in a job for which a lower educational level is required. The analyses use data from the BIBB/BAuA (Institute for Vocational Training/Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) Employment Survey 2018 and multilevel logistic models. The results show that the higher segment levels are associated with a lower probability of overqualification. These effects vary, however, according to gender. While there is no difference in the probability of overqualification in the higher and the middle segments for men, the higher segment is associated with a significantly lower probability of overqualification for women. Differences to men do not show up in the higher segment.  © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","Dual Education System; Gender; Overqualification; Segmentation; Training Occupation","","","","","","","","Achatz J., Geschlechtersegregation im Arbeitsmarkt, Arbeitsmarktsoziologie: Probleme, Theorien, Empirische Befunde, pp. 389-435, (2018); Alda H., Friedrich A., Rohrbach-Schmidt D., Educational Expansion and Educational Wage Premiums of Young Male Employees.

The design and implementation of programmes of work-based study which focus on an individual’s inherent talents are a new lens for higher education (HE), one that enables institutions to see diverse groups of students fulfil their potential and gain academic qualifications. Strength-based degree apprenticeships offer an effective way to align the needs of industry with the ambitions of individuals who wish to gain university level qualifications whilst in the workplace. Design/methodology/approach: The research adopted a mixed-methods approach. Semi-structured interviews with stakeholders in industry and HE were undertaken and thematically analysed. Student data were analysed quantitatively for students in the degree apprenticeship programmes which incorporate a strength-based approach to learning and assessment. Findings: The findings from this study highlight that the degree apprenticeships’ strength-based curriculum and assessment have spearheaded its success. On average, degree apprentices attain 10 per cent higher grades than students undertaking the same programme through the traditional degree route. Moreover, the module design and tailored support has contributed to over 91 per cent of apprentices graduating with a 2:1 or above. Research limitations/implications: This research is exploratory in nature, focusing on one university’s experiences and outcomes regarding a strength-based approach curriculum and assessment on degree apprenticeships. Originality/value: The findings describe how the knowledge exchange and culture of the HE sector has shifted, and the university’s efforts to make progressive relationships with employers. Moreover, this paper describes the challenges in designing curricula and assessing students based on the strengths and skills required for their employment, rather than university mandated learning outcomes. The findings of this paper could influence a strength-based framework for the development of degree apprenticeships in the UK. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Degree apprenticeships; Higher education; Strength-based approaches; Widening participation; Work-based learning","","","","","","","","Arjomandi A., Seufert J., O'Brien M., Anwar S., Active teaching strategies and student engagement: a comparison of traditional and non-traditional business students, E-Journal of Business Education and Scholarship Teaching, 12, 2, pp. 120-140, (2018); Brandle T., Lengfeld H., Drifting apart or converging?

Radiotherapy technology and postgraduate medical education have evolved significantly over the last two decades, but little is known of the educational impact of those changes within the dual training of the clinical oncology programme. A qualitative assessment of the radiotherapy component of training was undertaken at a single regional cancer centre in order to identify potential areas for improvement. Materials and methods: Consultants and trainees (n = 10) at a regional cancer centre underwent semi-structured interviews regarding their lived experience of learning radiotherapy skills and knowledge. As consultants and trainees can be considered equal co-investors in the process of radiotherapy learning, the same question stems were used for both groups. An interpretative phenomenological analysis was undertaken by the investigators to elicit the perception of both groups. Results: Consultant and trainee assessments of current radiotherapy learning standards differ for several aspects of training, as do their expectations of the other in learning processes. A lack of time is a major barrier in modern practice, and both groups can propose novel measures to improve learning locally. Conclusions: Arrangements for learning radiotherapy have not kept pace with the rate of change in the clinical oncology discipline. Trainees and consultants have contrasting views on the state of training, its strengths and weaknesses, and pathways to improvement, which should be reconciled by programme coordinators charged with upgrading the training system. © 2020 The Royal College of Radiologists","Apprenticeship; clinical oncology; learning; radiation oncology; radiotherapy; training","Clinical Competence; Education, Medical; Humans; Medical Oncology; Neoplasms; Radiation Oncology; United Kingdom; apprenticeship; article; clinical article; consultation; expectation; human; human experiment; perception; personal experience; radiation oncology; radiotherapy; semi structured interview; skill; clinical competence; education; medical education; neoplasm; oncology; radiation oncology; United Kingdom","","","","","Cancer Centre; Wellcome Trust, WT; Health Research Board, HRB","The lead researcher was supported by Friends of the Cancer Centre to undertake this research as part of a MSc Clinical Education at Queen's University Belfast, through the Dr Gary McGowan Scholarship.

The purpose of the study was to consider methodological, research and theoretical, legislative, educational, and methodological foundations regarding the practical orientation of the educational process of training lawyers as a paradigm for reforming higher legal education and determining the forms of organising the educational process aimed at improving the quality of legal education. The methodological framework of the study was formed considering philosophical, general scientific, and special scientific methods of scientific cognition. Conceptual approaches to the introduction of possible methodological forms of organising practical training of students into the educational process of higher legal educational institutions were proposed, considering the elements of the Bologna Process and the development of a unified educational space according to the European vector of development of Ukraine. The study considered methodological, scientific and theoretical, legal, and methodological foundations for a general understanding of the practical training of law students in the educational process, its functional purpose in the context of implementing the reform of legal education as a component of legal reform in Ukraine. The study emphasised the necessity of preserving and further developing fundamental higher legal education and combine it with the established national and foreign doctrines of law and the practical orientation of the educational process as a paradigm for reforming legal education in Ukraine. It was concluded that the development of practical skills and abilities of a legal education applicant occurs in the educational process due to various forms of methodological organisation of the educational process. In particular, the authors considered the features of conducting practical classes using case methods and solving incidents, as well as binary classes, practical training, working in a law clinic, performing dual education, taking part in court debates, etc. The practical value of this study lies in the fact that it proved the advisability of preserving the national traditions of higher legal education in the educational process and introducing new, progressive forms of the educational process aimed at improving the quality of higher legal education, which would meet the requirements of the labour market and the challenges facing a modern democratic society, global development trends and tasks of professional activity of lawyers in various fields. © 2021, National Academy of Legal Sciences of Ukraine.

The dominant position of the dual system, however, is being challenged by other training routes gaining significance, particularly tertiary education. This article investigates the extent to which this is leading to a restructuring of the dual system. Developments in school-based vocational programmes, trends of academisation and challenges deriving from qualifying low achievers are discussed. The growing significance of school-based programmes is linked to the gender impact of the vocational education and training (VET) system and the gender segmentation of the German labour market, while academisation reflects labour market demands for high skills. With dual study programmes and three and a half-year dual training, the dual system seeks to provide attractive training options for highly skilled young people. This, however, has made access to fully-qualifying vocational programmes very difficult for low-achieving young people, including migrants and refugees, thereby challenging the integration function of the German VET system. © The Author(s) 2020.","Academisation; gender; Germany; low-achieving youth; school-based vocational training; skill formation; transition system; vocational education and training","","","","","","","","Bildungsberichterstattung A., Bildung in Deutschland 2012.

It also demonstrates negative trends in adolescent health, which requires optimization and development of specific algorithms of medical support for students aged 14–22 years and older appropriate to their academic and practical workload. Objective: To assess adaptation of college students to learning conditions, depending on their health status, and to substanti-ate ways of improving their health care. Material and methods: We retrieved and analyzed information from the database of multicenter studies conducted within the unified program of the National Medical Research Center for Children’s Health of the Russian Ministry of Health. Our sample included 197 first-and second-year college boys from the cities of Omsk and Moscow studying to become welders and auto mechanics. The quality of life, health and well-being indicators were evaluated according to the International Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short-form (MOS SF-36). The students were divided into subgroups based on their health status. The statistical processing complied with modern requirements and criteria of evidence-based medicine. Results: We established that vocational schools admitted a significant number of applicants with the above specialty pref-erences suffering from chronic diseases (21.1–26 %). Results of the questionnaire-based survey of future welders and car mechanics revealed difficulties in adaptation to the educational process of the students with chronic disorders expressed by lower quality of life indicators, frequent health complaints and feelings of fatigue, especially in second-year students who experience an increasing academic and practical workload. Conclusions: Students with chronic diseases mastering professions with hazardous working conditions represent population at risk, require health monitoring, determination of professional suitability, and control over the working conditions in industrial practice. The importance of protecting health of future professionals is determined by implementation of practice-based training in 42 % of vocational schools. Models of school medicine proposed to optimize health care in comprehensive schools can be adapted to conditions of secondary vocational facilities. Foreign studies have proved feasibility of an early onset of work-related diseases in certain occupations, even before completion of training, thus necessitating vocational guidance, professional medical advice, and development of an effective system of medical support for adolescents and students. © 2020, Federal Center for Hygiene and Epidemiology.

This paper is part of an Independent Campus policy study initiated by the Ministry of Education and Culture of the Republic of Indonesia in 2020 with objects in 5 (five) universities: 2 (two) accredited A, 2 (two) accredited B, and 1 (one) accredited C The data was collected through on-line discussions, particularly regarding entrepreneurship programs. This study also distributed questionnaires related to questions about entrepreneurship programs to respondents from representatives of rectorate leaders, faculties, study programs, lecturers, and others. The analysis was carried out through quantitative techniques with the help of the Lisrel 87.0 program technique, enriched with qualitative techniques based on information obtained from on-line discussions. The results of the study found that campus policy factors, apprenticeship programs, and exploration of local potential had a positive effect on competency development, application, and entrepreneurship learning. In addition, learning that takes into account these factors also affect students' commitment to become entrepreneurs after completing their studies. The implementation of entrepreneurship programs must pay attention to these influencing factors, the contribution of indicators for each factor, and apply recognition related to standard processes and achievement of competency program results. © 2021 Corry Yohana.

We also draw from the 2011 GSS, a nationally representative survey, and Cox modeling to examine three early adult transitions–home-leaving, first union, and first marriage–to determine if apprenticeship programs facilitate earlier transitions compared to other educational streams. Our respondents expressed that they transitioned to adulthood more quickly than their peers, due to early employment and avoiding student debt, however, many also had trouble finding stable employment and often took on debt related to their training. Using nationally representative data, we find tradesmen tend to leave home earlier than their peers, they form first unions at younger ages but marry slightly later than their more highly educated counterparts. Our results contribute to our understanding of how apprenticeship programs in Canada facilitate transitions to adulthood among a recent cohort of young men. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","apprenticeship; educational choices; home leaving; skilled trades; Transition to adulthood; union formation","adult; adulthood; apprenticeship; article; Canada; Canadian; cohort analysis; employment; expectation; human; human experiment; interview; male; marriage","","","","","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","This work was supported by Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.","Allison P.D., Event History Analysis: Regression for Longitudinal Event Data, (1984); Arnett J.J., Kloep M., Hendry L.B., Tanner J.L., Debating Emerging Adulthood: Stage or Process?, (2011); Avery R., Goldscheider F., Speare A., Feathered Nest/Gilded Cage: Parental Income and Leaving Home in the Transition to Adulthood, Demography, 29, 3, pp. 375-388, (1992); Beaupre P., Turcotte P., Milan A., When is Junior Moving Out?

Complementary to the need of hybrid (specific and general) human capital for German Mittelstand firms, the system of tertiary dual education in Germany has succeeded in hitting two birds with one stone. Though Germany has often been criticized for its low rate of university graduates, the critique has largely failed to acknowledge the differentiation of Germany's dual tertiary education model. By highlighting the case of Baden-Württemberg and its Cooperative State University system, we illustrate the diversity of Germany’s landscape of higher education institutions. It appears that the availability of a large pool of tertiary dual educated students contributes in particular to the advantage of Mittelstand firms in Baden-Württemberg. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cooperative education; hidden champions; human capital; Mittelstand; Vocational education","","","","","","","","Acs Z.J., Stam E., Audretsch D.B., O'Connor A., The Lineages of the Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Approach, Small Business Economics, 49, 1, pp. 1-10, (2017); Anselin L., Varga A., Acs Z., Local Geographic Spillovers Between University Research and High Technology Innovations, Journal of Urban Economics, 42, 3, pp. 422-448, (1997); Audretsch D.B., Elston J.A., Financing the German Mittelstand, Small Business Economics, 9, 2, pp. 97-110, (1997); Audretsch D.B., Hulsbeck M., Lehmann E.E., Regional Competitiveness, University Spillovers, and Entrepreneurial Activity, Small Business Economics, 39, 3, pp. 587-601, (2012); Audretsch D.B., Lehmann E.E., The Seven Secrets of Germany: Economic Resilience in an Era of Global Turbulence, (2016); Audretsch D.B., Lehmann E.E., Schenkenhofer J., Internationalization Strategies of Hidden Champions: Lessons from Germany, Multinational Business Review, 26, 1, pp. 2-24, (2018); Becker G.S., Human Capital: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis, with Special Reference to Education, (1964); Berghoff H., The end of Family Business?

The integration of Ukrainian High School in European education considers the training of a universal specialist competent both in theoretical study and practical application of farming and engineering. The first attempts have already been done: dual education projects are encouraged by the Ministry of Education of Ukraine. The paper reports on teaching Physics through the implementation of profession based elements. Therefore, the aims of this paper are threefold: (1) to characterize the scientific knowledge in connecting theoretical and practical areas of study, to determine the basic characteristics according to standardized training programme future specialists in agriculture and engineering should have, (2) to develop the strategies for integrating the profession-based approach to teaching academic disciplines on the basis of the pedagogical experiment that involved 176 student-respondents and 41 teacher-respondents and (3) to create integrated curriculum, profession-based lecture samples and problem book in Physics for students majoring in Power Engineering in Agricultural Complex. The survey was carried out on the basis of the State Agrarian and Engineering University in Podillia, Lviv National Agrarian University and Nizhyn Agricultural University. To gain evidence about the effectiveness of implementation of profession-based material in Physics course in vocational training of future power engineers we used specially designed questionnaires, interviews and observation of behaviour. The results of the study proved that the use of profession-based material promotes the formation of student natural knowledge, as well as a wide range of practical skills and abilities.

Its development and implementation process are characterised by regional diversity and by the participation of a wide range of actors. However, the evolution of the relationships between and among actors in the field of Dual Vocational Education and Training in Spain has not yet been explored through network analysis. It is an emergent and increasing perspective in the field of international education research. Using social network analysis, this article explores the evolution over time of the activity and the formation of the actors’ network who debated on #fpdual on Twitter during the period between 2011 and 2019. The results revealed three different periods: the initial phase, the rapid increase and the consolidation of the activity in the debate. These periods show different trends in the incorporation of actors to the debate, ranging from a greater prominence of educational individual actors to a proliferation of the fields and the level they belong to. Companies, and particularly foundations, are prominent and occupy a central place in the network, both in terms of their production and the attention received. These findings could have significant implications when drawing future lines of research in relation to the governance of the Dual Vocational Education and Training subsystem in Spain. © 2021, Univ Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED).

University College of Estate Management’s (UCEM) new Level 3 Surveying Technician Apprenticeship programme was developed using a novel approach of flipped-blended learning, with assessment by e-portfolio and computer-marked assessments. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the challenges faced by UCEM as it moved into Level 3 provision with a new delivery approach and explains the lessons learned. Design/methodology/approach: A wide range of programme stakeholders – including UCEM’s senior leadership team, apprentice-management team, academic delivery team, surveying apprenticeship trailblazer group and learning designers – were interviewed to gather data for the study. Findings: A considerable volume of work was needed to implement the envisioned flipped-blended approach in the first phase of delivery. This was due to time constraints, unforeseen challenges of the new approach and compliance requirements. In addition, difficulties around communicating learning expectations with the apprentices regarding the flipped-blended model added an extra level of pressure in the delivery phase. Originality/value: UCEM has undergone several internal reorganisations to adapt to the uncertain political and educational landscape surrounding apprenticeship education. UCEM was the first provider of the new standard-based surveying apprenticeship and has the largest number of apprenticeship students on its programmes. The journey UCEM has taken and the problems it has overcome will be valuable to individuals and institutions looking to enter this market segment. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Apprenticeships; Blended learning; Flipped learning; Surveying technician","","","","","","","","Bryman A., Social Research Methods, (2008); Butt A., Student views on the use of a flipped classroom approach: evidence from Australia, Business Education & Accreditation, 6, 1, pp. 33-43, (2014); Chitty C., Towards a New Education System: The Victory of the New Right?, (1989); Cohen L., Manion L., Morrison K., Research Methods in Education, (2011); Apprenticeship funding: apprenticeship funding in England from May 2017, (2016); Guidance apprenticeship funding: how it will work, (2017); Felstead A., Fuller A., Jewson N., Unwin L., Working to Learn, Learning to Work, (2011); Graham C.R., Blended learning systems: definition, current trends, and future directions, The Handbook of Blended Learning:Global Perspectives, Local Designs, pp. 3-21, (2006); Graham C.R., Allen S., Ure D., Benefits and challenges of blended learning environments, Encyclopedia of Information Science and Technology, pp. 253-259, (2005); Hajhashemi K., Caltabiano N., Anderson N., Integrating digital technologies in the classroom: lecturers’ views on the flipped classroom approach, Australian and International Journal of Rural Education, 26, 3, pp. 18-29, (2016); Harris M., Modern Apprenticeships: an assessment of the government’s flagship training programme, (2003); Flipped learning, (2017); English apprenticeships: our 2020 Vision, (2015); Muhlemann S., The cost and benefits of work-based learning, (2016); Richard D., The Richard review of apprenticeships, (2012); (1922); Improving working as learning, (2008); Wallis P., Apprenticeship and training in premodern England, (2007); Wolf A., Review of vocational education – the wolf report, (2011); Yin R.K., Case Study Research: Design and Methods, (2014); Government kick-starts plans to reach 3 million apprenticeships, (2015)","T.R.

This is especially crucial in the vocational education context, which is closer to the world of work and, therefore, more sensitive to the disruptive changes of digitalisation. This chapter addresses this issue by proposing the result of a project that aimed to identify a new professional profile in the context of dual vocational education in Switzerland. The Digital Facilitator is a new term that refers to a teacher with advanced digital competency who is an expert in facilitating digital innovation adoption within educational institutions. Thus, it constitutes a possible concrete way to address the issue of integrating the individual and the organisational perspectives related to digital transformation. The profile is discussed by presenting an analysis of acknowledged existing frameworks and by considering the specificities of the context in which it was developed. The opportunities and challenges associated with introducing the profile are also critically addressed. © The Author(s) 2021.","Competence profile; Digital skills; School digital transformation; Teacher education; Vocational education","","","","","","","","Aagaard T., Lund A., Digital agency in Higher Education.

All degree apprenticeship programmes within England must align to these and for allied health professions, this is a new concept. Exploring stakeholder motivations for being part of the trailblazer groups is essential to inform subsequent curriculum design and implementation for this new model of education. Methods: Eighteen semi-structured interviews were undertaken across the three radiography related (diagnostic, therapeutic and sonography) trailblazer groups using a pragmatic constructivist approach. Results: Strong themes emerged around professional recognition, and conflicts between being ‘educated’ or ‘trained’, and between vocational and academic components of radiography training. Even within these pioneer groups there was a lack of understanding around degree apprenticeship programmes and their potential impact upon the workforce. Whilst the benefits on recruitment and retention of staff through widening participation were acknowledged, there were concerns around apprentice pay and mentorship. Evidence of professional protectionism was uncovered, balanced by professional pride and a strong desire for team working within and between institutions. Conclusion: The study highlighted an urgent need for further research and awareness raising for employers and practitioners, prior to implementation of radiography-related degree apprenticeships. Implications for practice: This is the first evaluation of stakeholder motivations related to the development of degree apprenticeships within the allied health professions. The results and recommendations for practise will inform the imminent implementation of degree apprenticeships for the three radiography related professions, facilitating a smooth transition to apprenticeships for clinical and education departments. © 2019 The College of Radiographers","Degree apprenticeships; Diagnostic radiography; Higher education; Professional recognition; Sonography; Therapeutic radiography","Allied Health Personnel; Clinical Competence; Curriculum; Education, Professional; England; Humans; Inservice Training; Motivation; Radiology; Workforce; apprenticeship; article; awareness; controlled study; echography; employer; human; human experiment; mentor; motivation; paramedical profession; physician; radiography; semi structured interview; vocation; workforce; clinical competence; curriculum; education; England; in service training; paramedical personnel; procedures; radiology; vocational education","","","","","College of Radiographers Industry Partnerships Scheme, (153)","We would like to thank the participants who gave their time to contribute to this study and to the College of Radiographers Industry Partnerships Scheme for their support.

The ranking of the best universities for the implementation of the dual education system is analyzed within the framework of previous studies on the matter. It is noted that in the system of dual education a significant role is given to the formation of the personality of the specialist. It is emphasized that dual education is aimed at raising awareness of students' educational and professional activities. The main competences of the student at different levels (practical training, content and structure of educational programs, level of mutual trust, level of adaptation to the work process, level of learning motivation, level of precision in understanding the profession, level of standardized training) are described. The importance of practical orientation of the education system based on acquired competences (solving real production problems, reforming research work, participation in scientific and practical conferences) is emphasized. Recommendations on the process of introducing dual education are provided and models for classification of professional development resources, components of conceptual model, principles of formation of the structure and content of the educational programs, indicators of professional skills and ones’ development are offered. © 2021.

The discrepancy between training and practice makes it difficult to undertake these approaches. It has become apparent that pharmacy education needs to respond to professional and social changes and renew its mission in terms of students and learning objectives. ""In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice, but in practice there is,"" stated Manfred Eigen. This chapter will focus on approaches for bridging the theory-practice gap. First of all, these differences can be resolved by carrying out realistic research. Pharmacy institutions should perform advanced research to determine the needs and to promote and support the practice. Numerous literature studies support the proposition to include pharmacists in inter-professional primary health care teams. Country-based research will help confirm whether the training system and education obtained by pharmacy students is sufficient to promote a positive attitude toward potential integration into primary health care. Second, common, clear, and compelling outcomes should be established based on previous studies, and education should be standardized accordingly. A well-rounded student of pharmacy is created by a high-quality pharmacy school, a well-formed curriculum that meets the requirements, and a highly effective style and method of education. The curriculum of apprenticeships should be improved. The enhancement of apprenticeship programs should not be limited to increasing the number of apprenticeship courses, but should also extend to the quality of their content. Simulation training can play an important role in upscaling and improving pharmacy learning productivity and in overcoming the barrier of limited real-field learning. Lastly, the disparity between community-based and hospital-based apprenticeships and the courses attributed to graduates must be reduced to provide compatibility with pharmacy practice. Inter-professional education (IPE) should be introduced into the curriculum. One of the major obstacles to the success of the pharmacist in providing primary health care is presented when the pharmacist is directly involved in patient care and this role is ignored by other health care providers. Inter-professional education prepares students for collaborative thinking and practice. Building this collaborative project through education has a major impact on bridging the gaps between different providers of primary health care. In summary, the recommendations proposed include: continuing professional development (CPD) to enhance the workforce, incorporating technologies and software in pharmacy education, evaluating the education process from different aspects (students, practitioners, primary health care providers), restructuring the curriculum according to research feedback, and finally, effectively collaborating with other health care providers (""One hand can't clap alone""). © 2020 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Curriculum; Interprofessional education; Pharmacy education; Practice; Simulation; Technologies","","","","","","","","The Definition of Clinical Pharmacy, Pharmacotherapy, 28, 6, pp. 816-817, (2008); ACCP White Paper, Interprofessional Education: Principles and Application.

The model has three main components: (1) the costs that arise during the programme (training, student labour, administrative, and educational supplies), (2) the benefits that companies receive during the programme in terms of student’s productivity, and (3) the potential benefits that companies can obtain in hiring and adjustment savings if students are hired after the programme. Using an online survey, we estimate that Chilean companies that participate incur net costs of US$3,200 per student per year in training; however, most companies declared to be satisfied with dual training. We simulate two scenarios under which dual training is cost effective. Public policies to promote early adjustment such that students arrive at companies better prepared and can allocate more time to productive tasks should be considered to decrease the net cost of training. © 2021 The Vocational Aspect of Education Ltd.","vet and the labour market; Vocational education & training; workplace learning","","","","","","Ministerio de Educación, Gobierno de Chile, MINEDUC, (ANID/FONDAP/15130009)","This research was funded by the Ministry of Education, Nestlé and Fundación Chile Dual.

Less investigated in the literature is what employer characteristics that are conducive for their willingness to hire a disadvantaged apprentice: both on the level of the organisation and of the recruiter. I draw on organisational and institutional literature and on person-organisation fit and ethical decision-making theory to formulate expectations regarding the preferences of the organisations and recruiters. The applied method is a factorial survey experiment administered to in-firm vocational trainers with recruitment authority in the commercial occupation in Switzerland. The findings show that public sector employers are more lenient towards candidates with weaker academic achievements than employers in the private sector. Moreover, respondents with a more egalitarian outlook on the access to vocational training for disadvantaged youths tend to lower their thresholds for the candidates’ academic achievements. © 2019 The Vocational Aspect of Education Ltd.","disadvantaged youth; Dual VET; employers’ preferences; factorial survey; school-to-work transition","","","","","","Staatssekretariat für Bildung, Forschung und Innovation, SBFI","Prior to introducing the ten vignettes to the respondents, we explained the evaluation setting mentioning that each candidate should be rated independently from one another and provided some general information about the fictitious candidates.

As the 30th anniversary of this unique dual-training opportunity approaches, multiple changes to the practice and educational landscape have occurred. Previous surveys examining this topic are now more than 10 years old and occurred prior to the establishment of the EM/IM/critical care medicine (EM/IM/CCM) pathway. We conducted a survey to investigate career trajectories, satisfaction, and opportunities available to EM/IM graduates. Methods: Survey questions were developed to both allow for comparison with previously published data and examine new topics not previously investigated. A group of EM/IM and EM/IM/CCM program directors validated the survey questions. Eligible respondents were identified and contacted through their previous residency program leadership. Results: Fifty-two percent (152/290) of graduates completed the survey. Thirty-seven percent of respondents practice both EM and IM, 51% practice EM only, and the remainder practice IM only. Thirty-one percent of total respondents completed a fellowship, with critical care being the most popular choice. Seventy-one percent of graduates practice in an academic center, and many hold leadership positions within education, research, and hospital administration. Eighty-seven percent of graduates were “extremely satisfied” with their choice to pursue EM/IM or EM/IM/CCM and 95% reported that they would choose this path again. Conclusions: Most respondents are satisfied with their residency choice and would choose to pursue this training again, despite the additional years of training.

The Advanced Clinical Practitioner training programme has been introduced to support this need. The aim of this work was to systematically review studies that explore advanced practice in mammography to assess the potential impact of the introduction of a specific Advanced Clinical Practitioner training programme in breast diagnosis within the UK. Methods: A systematic PRISMA review of the literature published between 1999 and January 2020 was carried out. A total of 17 studies were included in the review. Results: Four themes were identified in the literature in relation to advanced practice in breast imaging: multidisciplinary practice; roles and responsibilities associated with advanced practice; development and progression; embedding and sustaining advanced practice. It was evident across all themes that advanced practice is vital in supporting better care for patients attending breast imaging in light of workforce shortages. Although advanced practice and its benefits are well established in breast imaging, persistent barriers were acknowledged such as role ambiguity, recruitment issues, lack of support from some radiologists and poor funding. Conclusion: Findings suggest that introducing a more formalised pathway to advanced practice into breast imaging through the implementation of a specific Advanced Clinical Practitioner apprenticeship training programme may overcome many of the challenges evidenced in this review. Implications for practice: The findings of this review will help inform the development of the Advanced Clinical Practitioner apprenticeship programme specific to breast diagnosis. © 2020 The College of Radiographers","Advanced practice; Breast screening; Cancer; Consultant practitioner; Extended role; Mammography","Humans; Mammography; advanced practice provider; ambiguity; breast cancer; cancer screening; clinical practice; consultant practitioner; education program; funding; Great Britain; human; imaging; mammographer; mammography; national health service; Northern Ireland; personnel management; personnel shortage; physician; physician assistant; radiographer; radiologist; Review; social support; systematic review; technician; United Kingdom; X ray","","","","","Health Education England","This work was funded and commissioned by Health Education England .","Breast cancer statistics, (2020); More people are living with and beyond cancer than ever before, (2016); Hudson A., Zarifeh L., Young, Wells J.E., Patients' expectations of screening and preventive treatments, Ann Fam Med, 2012, (2012); Hardy M., Nightingale J., Conceptualising the transition from advanced to consultant practitioner: career promotion or significant life event?, J Med Imag Radiat Sci, 45, pp. 356-364, (2016); British Society of Breast Radiology, Breast Cancer Res, 21, (2019); NHS England, Transforming imaging services in England: a national strategy for imaging networks; Society and College of Radiographers, Introduction; Department of Health, The NHS Plan.

Design: Cross-sectional observational survey sent worldwide to ∼550 practicing cardiac ICU attending physicians. Setting: Hospitals providing cardiac critical care. Subjects: Practicing cardiac critical care physicians. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: We received responses from 243 ICU attending physicians from 82 centers (14 countries). The primary training background of the respondents included critical care (62%), dual training in critical care and cardiology (16%), cardiology (14%), and other (8%). We received 49 responses from medical directors in nine countries, who reported that the predominant training background for attending physicians who provide cardiac intensive care at their institutions were critical care (58%), dual trained (18%), cardiology (12%), and other (11%). A greater proportion of physicians trained in either critical care or dual-training reported feeling confident managing multiple organ failure, neurologic conditions, brain death, cardiac arrest, and performing procedures like advanced airway placement and inserting chest- and abdominal-drains. In contrast, physicians with cardiology and dual-training reported feeling more confident managing intractable arrhythmias, understanding cardiopulmonary interactions, and interpreting echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, and cardiac catheterization. Overall, only 57% of the respondents felt comfortable based on their current training background to manage patients with complex cardiac issues without collaboration with other specialists. Conclusions: Our survey demonstrates that intensivists trained in critical care are more comfortable with critical care skills, cardiology-trained intensivists are more comfortable with cardiology skills, and dual-trained physicians are comfortable with both critical care skills and cardiology skills. These findings may help inform future efforts to optimize the educational curriculum and training pathways for future cardiac intensivists. These data may also be used to shape continuing medical education activities for cardiac intensivists who have already completed their training. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Higher education policy reforms are looking for the right solution and we consider dual education as one such solution. The aim of our research is to present the perspectives of students, partner companies and lecturers on the perception of the effectiveness of the dual education and the quality of the practical training, which has been present at the University of Debrecen since the 2015/2016 academic year. The DUAL 2019 (N = 286) database was used, the data collection took place in the semester of 2018/2019, our results were supported by both quantitative and qualitative data. We were looking for the answer to the question of which student group had the best academic performance. We hypothesize that dual training has a positive effect on students ’academic performance. Based on student self-reports and quantitative results have shown that dual students have better academic performance than those in traditional education. In the interview part of the research it was revealed that the students perceive significant development of skills, but our results call for further quantitative procedures.Our results is indispensable in the sense that we must constantly monitor these educational policy reforms, because monitoring processes are essential in educational research. © Association for Research in Post‐Compulsory Education (ARPCE).","academic performance; Dual education; labour market; student employment; traineeship","","","","","","Emberi Eroforrások Minisztériuma, EMMI, (ÚNKP-18-3)","This research was supported through the New National Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities.

SCAN facilitates a convergent evaluation by the different actors of the Dual University Training (FDU) in the degree of Primary Education: the university teaching staff, the Teachers in Initial Training (DFI) and the school mentors. This case study analyses with two checkpoints the evolution of narratives about educational practices in schools. It focuses mainly on the relationship between theory and practice through the assessment of four dimensions: Description, Comprehension, Projection and Formal Aspects. The narrative analysis of 150 DFIs shows a significant improvement between the pre-test and post-test, especially relevant in the Projection dimension. This is evidenced in the following categories: Teaching Competencies, Teaching Intervention and Development Opportunities. In conclusion, the training with narratives contributes to the development of Professional Vision from a critical review of practice. In this study SCAN shows its efficiency in the analysis and evaluation of the DFIs narratives. © 2021 Asociacion Interuniversitaria de Investigacion en Pedagogia.

The study's goal is to identify and highlight the development trends of practical training of college students in the new digital society. The study was carried out on the basis of the Polytechnic College No. 8 and the Russian State Agrarian University - Moscow Timiryazev Agricultural Academy. Basic methods involved the analysis of scientific and pedagogical literature, regulatory documents, SWOT analysis, generalization, observation, pedagogical experiment. The authors make a strong case for improving the practice-oriented component of vocational education in the context of it digital transformation. For this purpose, network interaction is actively implemented as a prototype of the dual education system. Analyzing the case of a polytechnic college, the authors show the advantages of using computer models in the process of practical preparation, including the SinuTrain program, which can fully simulate the operation of numerically controlled metal-working machines on a personal computer. In the context of the digital transformation of education, an important trend is the use of VR/AR technologies in the training process. The paper outlines the effectiveness of cooperation between the college and partner enterprises in preparing students for the demonstration exam. The authors prove the necessity of transforming practical training in colleges into a system of dual education on the basis of network interaction. This can be implemented in the form of study and production clusters. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.","","Agricultural robots; Apprentices; E-learning; Education computing; Metal working; Personal computers; College students; Development trends; Digital transformation; Education systems; Network interaction; Practical training; Regulatory documents; Vocational education; Students","","","","","","","Scherer R., Howard S.K., Tondeur J., Siddiq F., Computers in Human Behavior, 118, (2020); Iivari N., Sharma S., Venta-Olkkonen L., International Journal of Information Management, 55, (2020); Bratti M., Conti M., Sulis G., Labour Economics, 69, (2021); Berg H.V.D., Learning and Individual Differences, 40, pp. 84-89, (2015); Kamenez N.V., Smirnova Z.V., Vaganova O.I., Bystrova N.V., Tsarapkina J.M., International Journal of Mechanical Engineering and Technology, 10, 2, pp. 899-907, (2019); Kucirkova L., Alipichev Yu A., Vasbieva D.G., Kalugina O.A., XLinguae, 10, 2, pp. 63-77, (2017); Zain S., Future Directions in Digital Information, pp. 223-234, (2020); Kubrushko P.F., Alipichev A.Y., Kozlenkova E.N., Nazarova L.I., Siman A.S., Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1691, 1, (2020); Fleaca E., Stanciu R.D., Procedia Manufacturing, 32, pp. 1051-1057, (2019); Ivanov I., Cobo J.C., Kosonogova M., Procedia Computer Science, 172, pp. 517-522, (2020); Moldovan L., Procedia Manufacturing, 46, pp. 263-270, (2020); Zeer E.F., Tretyakova V.S., Bukovey T.D., Scherbina E.Y., Humanities and Social Sciences Reviews, 7, 4, pp. 1080-1085, (2019); Zeer E.F., Zinnatova M.V., Bukovei T.D., ARPN Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences, 12, 11, (2017); Zanfirova L.V., Kovalenok T.P., Ovsyannikova E.A., Chistova Y.S., Sergeeva N.A., Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1691, 1, (2020); Kubrushko P., Kozlenkova E., Mikhailenko O., Nazarova L., International conference on the theory and practice of personality formation in modern society (ictppfms-18), Facilitation of Innovative Pedagogical Activity of University Teachers.

Studies usually show that companies act as recipients of locally generated knowledge, and not as producers of knowlege. Recruiting graduates of local vocational schools and universities enables the companies to play this role. However, companies sometimes also act as providers of knowledge, in the sense that they offer apprenticeships or comprehensive internships for pupils and students. This article focuses on this interface of ‘dual’ actvities, which connect the companies with vocational schools and universities. Recently, the concept of the skills ecosystem, which addresses this interface within the local actor network, has become popular. Starting with this concept and embedding it into the debate of economic geography, this contribution focusses on Mexico and investigates how the local actors integrate companies in dual activities. Based on qualitative methods, the study illustrates that there is a two-part skills ecosystem in Mexico’s Central Highland. The smaller part consists of dual vocational education and training and is found in the technological ‘high-road’ part of the economy.

Research indicates that effective implementation of the dual VET system is contingent upon successful integration of learning experience at the two venues. Recent graduates, workplace trainers, and teachers in all 51 certified trades answered an electronic questionnaire (667 participants, response rate 24%). Factor analysis of responses to 22 statements resulted in the identification of five factors. Findings show that the learning venues were parallel rather than integrated. Communication and collaboration between teachers and workplace trainers were limited and recent graduates, in particular, did not experience the program as a coherent whole. The results also showed important variations in the perspectives of the three groups of participants. The duration of the workplace learning period was not found to be associated with perceptions of program integration. Some limited effects of sequencing were found, but no clear pattern emerged. This study adds to knowledge on learning and integration, and indicates possible ways of improving program coherence and integration in a dual VET system. © 2020 by the author.

Some ofthe perceived quality characteristics of WET are related to the various roles that apprentices assume at school and in the training company and the consequences that these roles may have on their apprenticeship experience. On the basis of dual apprentices' responses (N=336), an exploratory factor analysis has identified four dimensions referring to role tensions; path analyses showed that the perception of role tensions was negatively related to self-efficacy, commitment and satisfaction. These results illustrate that different role stress can be associated with the WET apprentices 'experience, and that this stress has negative effects on the apprentices 'well-being.

By surveying 722 randomly selected respondents participating in the DSVTP program, we examined the effects of students’ satisfaction with their learning and internship in the program on their intentions to stay at their current jobs. We employed structural equation modeling to analyze the associations among factors. Our empirical results revealed positive correlations between learning satisfaction, job involvement, dual system satisfaction, and intentions to stay at the current job. These empirical results also suggested that students participating DSVTP are largely satisfied with this program and would promote them to stay at current job, which in turn helps to alleviate youth unemployment. On the basis of the statistical analysis results, policy implications that could serve as a reference in future reforms of the DSVTP in Taiwan are also discussed. © 2021, The Author(s).","Common method variance; Dual education system; Intentions to stay; Structural equation modeling (SEM); Taiwan","","","","","","","","Anderson E., Sullivan M., The antecedents and consequences of customer-satisfaction for firms, Mark Sci, 12, 2, pp. 125-143, (1993); Appleton J., Christenson S., Furlong M., Student engagement with school: critical conceptual and methodological issues of the construct, Psychol Sch, 45, 5, pp. 369-386, (2008); Beggs B., Ross C., Bryan G., A comparison of student and practitioner perspectives of the travel and tourism internship, J Hosp Leis Sport Tour Educ, 7, 1, pp. 31-39, (2008); Byrne B., Structural Equation Modeling with AMOS: Basic Concepts, Applications, and Programming, (2010); Chang S.-J., van Witteloostuijn A., Eden L., From the editors: common method variance in international business research, J Int Bus Stud, 41, 2, pp. 178-184, (2010); Chen C.-T., Chen C.-F., The influence of internship experiences on the behavioral intentions of college students in Taiwan, Asia Pac Educ Res, 20, 1, pp. 73-92, (2011); Chen Z.-L., Shen C.-C., The influence of internship program on students’ career choice: case from hospitality and tourism related department in higher vocational education, J Hosp Tour, 8, 1, pp. 21-38, (2011); Cheung G., Rensvold R., Evaluating goodness-of-fit indexes for testing measurement invariance, Struct Equ Model, 9, 2, pp. 233-255, (2002); Cronin J., Taylor S., Measuring service quality: a reexamination and extension, J Mark, 56, 3, pp. 55-68, (1992); Dawis R., Lofquist L., A Psychological Theory of Work Adjustment: An Individual-Differences Model and Its Application, (1984); Eichhorst W., Does Vocational Training Help Young People Find a (Good) Job?, IZA World of Labor, 112, pp. 1-10, (2014); Fornell C., Larcker D., Evaluating structural equation models with unobservable variables and measurement error: algebra and statistics, J Mark Res, 18, 3, pp. 382-388, (1981); Forster-Heinzer S., Holtsch D., Rohr-Mentele S., Eberle F., Do They Intend to Stay?

This exploratory paper seeks to discuss the disruptive potential of digitalization in the current Swiss VET context on three levels: Debates and concerns, politics and practices. Firstly, topical concerns regarding the future of work and the performance of VET as a training model are discussed. Secondly, the paper argues that the level of educational practice is a promising field of study in assessing the disruptive potential of digitalization, especially in dual training systems. The examples provided in this paper show that VET providers (both schools and firms) take different courses of action with respect to digitalization. They also demonstrate that the outcomes of digitalization for educational practice vary according to training needs and occupational requirements. Thirdly, digitaliza-tion emerges to a focal point in the present political agenda. Besides the promises and premises of a fundamentally changing VET landscape, digitalization primarily takes place as a gradual process of change. © Peter Lang Group AG, International Academic Publishers, Bern 2021.

Our contribution to the literature is threefold. First, we apply a method that has rarely been used in this literature to control for potential selection biases. Second, this method allows us to distinguish between the programmes’ direct effect (conditional on educational achievement) and indirect effect (via educational achievement) on labour market outcomes. Third, we examine the impact of two distinct dual apprenticeship programmes in a novel setting: Flanders (Belgium). We find evidence for short-term labour market advantages only for the programme with the most days of on-the-job training, which fade out quickly over time. © 2020","Dynamic selection; Education; Labour; Transitions in youth; Vocational education","Belgium; Flanders; educational attainment; employment; labor market; literature review; secondary education; training","","","","","","","Adda J., Dustmann C., Meghir C., Robin J.M., Career progression and formal versus on-the-job training, IFS Working Papers, 10/13, (2010); Albanese A., Cappellari L., Leonardi M., The effects of youth labor market reforms: Evidence from Italian apprenticeships, IZA Discussion Papers, (2017); Altonji J.G., Blom E., Meghir C., Heterogeneity in human capital investments: High school curriculum, college major, and careers, Annual Review of Economics, 4, pp. 185-223, (2012); Angrist J.D., Graddy K., Imbens G., The interpretation of instrumental variables estimators in simultaneous equations models with an application to the demand for fish, Review of Economic Studies, 67, pp. 499-527, (2000); Angrist J.D., Krueger A.B., Does compulsory school attendance affect schooling and earnings?, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 106, pp. 979-1074, (1991); Baert S., Cockx B., Pure ethnic gaps in educational attainment and school to work transitions.

That is why, in this article, the authors analyze the processes of educational and qualitative personality growth based on diffusion-like models of the process of knowledge potential dissemination and redistribution. In particular, an emphasis is put on the process description (modeling) of the knowledge potential redistribution in the formation of the system of professional competencies. The conceptual and nonlinear mathematical models of information processes of the agents’ “knowledge potentials” formation are developed taking into account their constituent components and customer requests. In particular, the procedure of constructing the previously proposed multi-component two-dimensional array of discrete values of the knowledge potential constituent components for generating procedures to enhance (improve) the professional competencies of knowledge sources, is generalized and specified. The general approaches to the formation of the corresponding optimization problems are determined (in particular, the minimization of the employer and educational institution costs and the time for training an agent in the dual system). © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Agent; Dual education; Educational institution; Knowledge potential; Marketing environment; Professional competencies; Stakeholder","Industrial engineering; Educational institutions; Information process; Multicultural environment; Nonlinear mathematical model; Optimization problems; Process descriptions; Professional competencies; Two-dimensional arrays; Engineering","","","","","","","Lisichk E., Postnikova E., Tverdokhlebov S., Formation of professional competence of students in engineering education, Creat.

This article reviewed the literature on cognitive apprenticeship to apply this instructional model to the fields of management education and workplace learning. First, the characteristics of cognitive apprenticeship were described and compared to traditional apprenticeship. Then, literature was reviewed in the fields of educational management. It was found that the literature can be categorized by setting (workplace vs. classroom) and communication process (face-to-face vs. web-based). Research on workplace setting is limited, and most studies have focused on the method of cognitive apprenticeship rather than other components of the model such as content, sequence, and sociology. Based on the review, this paper proposes to: (1) create face-to-face and web-based cognitive apprenticeship programs for management education, (2) integrate a cognitive apprenticeship model with coaching research, including the coaching of students, and (3) develop a measurement scale for evaluating teachers and instructors in management education. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cognitive apprenticeship;

However, in Colombia, high unemployment rates and the informality of young people are risks of achieving these goals. The purpose of this research is to estimate the determinants of youth unemployment and its relationship with SDGs Objective 8, and linking it to the objectives of quality education and gender equity. Using the microdata of the Colombian household survey, DANE, this relationship is estimated with a methodology of age, period, and cohort, through a Probit/Logit Multinomial model. As a novel result for the Colombian case, it is shown that, although new generations of young people are more educated, education per se is not enough to guarantee them a quality insertion into the labor market, penalizing, above all, young women. Lack of work experience and segmentation of the labor market would help explain this outcome. Employment policies, therefore, to achieve the SDGs must not only invest in education, but also expand dual education programs, considering gender. © 2020 by the authors.","Cohort study; Human capital; Multinomial logit model; Probit model; Sustainable development goals; Youth unemployment","Colombia; cohort analysis; employment; human capital; labor market; sustainability; sustainable development; unemployment; young population","","","","","","","Transforming our world: The 2030 agenda for sustainable development, General Assembley 70 Session;, (2015); Kline B., First Along the River: A Brief History of the US Environmental Movement;, (2011); Pearce D., An intellectual history of environmental economics, Annu.

We distinguish between firm-level and regional-level factors influencing firms to form institutionally costly partnerships with vocational schools and government entities for the sake of upgrading skill formation.

Teachers are in the process of adapting to develop the digital skills they need for the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), a process that must be permanent and in which there are still knowledge gaps undermining its application. This study aims to determine whether this lack of digital skills is influenced by the gender of teachers, for example, whether there is a gender gap in ICT application in teaching, specifically Dual Vocational Education and Training, which is a teaching area that has been growing exponentially in recent years. A descriptive quantitative method has been used for this study with a sample of 1568 teachers of Dual Vocational Education and Training from the Autonomous Community of Andalusia, with data collected through a questionnaire. The results show that while the level of knowledge of ICT resources is medium among this group and is therefore improvable, there are no significant gender differences between teachers with respect to the application of e-skills by teaching professionals, despite the existence in other contexts of a large digital gender gap in new technology professionals. © 2020 by the authors.

Engineering education institutions are pushed to change and integrate more student‐centred learning methodologies in their curriculum, such as problem‐based, project‐organised learning (PBL). PBL enables engineering students to develop knowledge and competences aforementioned. Furthermore, PBL provides opportunities to increase and diversify the collaboration between universities and industry, fostering innovation. Industry case examples have been proved to increase student interest and motivation. However, this paper describes a step forward on that industry‐university collaboration level: involving companies in the project based learning experience. That is, involving the company in the tutoring and evaluation of a project developed by different groups of students. This could be understood as a dual training format more adequate for intermediate levels of bachelor degrees, when students are not mature enough to do a job in a company and get paid for it. This paper describes the experience of the Faculty of Engineering, Gipuzkoa (University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU, Spain) in supporting PBL integration in curriculum and in building industry collaboration. This paper descries the strategy Faculty of Engineering, Gipuzkoa (University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU, Spain) implemented with aim to develop a more innovative engineering education by re‐organising their courses around projects and in collaboration with companies. Furthermore, the faculty’s strategy is compressive, meaning that includes different strategies giving the students different learning experiences and contact with work place and employers in different moments of their education. © The authors, 2020.","Academic staff training; Company projects; Dual training; PBL","","","","","","","","PBL Problem‐based learning, (2015); Andersen A., Persavento U., Wang Z.

The sample groups were students learning through a new way of agricultural farm work and those learning agriculture through normal method. They were 90 sixth year upper secondary school students from Buntharik Wittayakhan School, Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand obtained by purposive sampling. This study consisted of 3 steps: 1) investigation and development of model of a new way agricultural farm work (animal science and teaching form); 2) analysis of consistent components suitable for the development of a new form of animal farm work and teaching/learning form; and 3) using the model together with the integration between theories and teaching methods (Learning by doing, POE, Group process, Blended learning, and field trip). This also included learning through application multimedia for learning exchange and activity transfer. There was control group design after testing. The instrument of research were interview schedule, questionnaire, learning achievement test, set of learning activities, and observation form. Results of the study revealed that the students learning through the dual education or a new way of agricultural farm work had higher learning achievement than that of those who learned through a normal class with a significance level (p>0.01). This finding indicated that learning through a new way of agricultural farm work was very essential to the development of learning achievement and skills. It was also found that the students had a high level of satisfaction with the blended learning and it should be promoted as part of the dual education in agriculture. © 2020 The Authors.","Agricultural farm work;

The main directions of cooperation, which are already applied in their practical activity by higher education institutions and business representatives, are highlighted. In particular, this is: assistance to businesses in organization of industrial practice of students; assistance in the organization of dual education on the basis of enterprises; interaction through social partnership; involvement of employers in job fairs and open days organized by universities; sponsorship in conferences, roundtables, forums. Priority ways of further cooperation of business structures and universities of Ukraine are determined, first of all through: creation of scientific centers, laboratories, business incubators; reading introductory lectures business representatives for university students; giving companies the opportunity to participate in discussing and preparing student curricula and plans; development of a system of charitable financial support of universities by business structures. Based on the analysis of the results of sociological surveys, problems have been found in establishing communication links between business and universities, in the employment of graduates, in financing university projects. It is established that the main factor determining the prospects of cooperation between business and universities is the support of this process at the national legislative level.

One of the reasons is the current disproportion between the real numbers of secondary school students and the employers’ needs. Another reason is that the study fields and the numbers of students are not planned in accordance with the needs of national or regional economy. School performance determination is a problem in which the interests of schools and public are confronted. The paper is crucially focused on design of a tool for a relevant estimation of numbers of students to be accepted to study the particular study branches of vocational education in transport and transport services.

Political and economic world crises, wars, and demographic instability entailed a threat to identity preservation by the national education systems. The objective of the paper is to examine the problem of the adaptation of migrants and refugees using the example of the German dual education system and efforts to resolve it by the federal government, the Federal Institute of Vocational Education, chambers of commerce, and industry and professional schools. The leading research methods were the scientific text analysis, expert interviews, and content analysis of empirical materials. As a result of the study, difficulties arising when migrants or refugees are involved in vocational education in the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) were identified; necessary conditions for effectiveness and sustainability of the dual education system as the national identity product were determined. The study materials can be useful for the researchers of the vocational education system of those countries with a high migration activity to determine mechanisms for responding to globalization changes, as well as vocational education systems of the countries seeking to borrow the German dual education experience in order to create conditions for the effective functioning of a similar educational model. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Dual education system; Globalization; Internalization; Migration crisis","","","","","","Russian Foundation of Basic Researches; Russian Foundation for Basic Research, RFBR, (18-013-00695A)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Russian Foundation of Basic Researches under the Grant ‘The Prospects and Terms for the German Dual Education Elements Adopting to the RF Vocational Education’ [18-013-00695A].; Funding text 2: Acknowledgment.

The students need trained teachers who know how to use Information and communication technologies (ICTs) and develop them into pedagogy. However, some of them do not know how. This phenomena is called “The generational digital divide”, which occurs when teachers do not have sufficient digital or technological skills or do not adapt to them. This article aims to determine whether the age of teachers has an influence on their knowledge about Information and Communication Technologies. The objective is to detect if there really exists a digital gap between generations, specifically in Dual Vocational Education Training, a kind of education which has been growing in the recent years. To do so, a study with a quantitative and descriptive method has been carried out, with the participation of 1.568 teachers of this training modality in the Autonomous Community of Andalusia. The data were extracted by means of a questionnaire to measure the level of digital teaching competence in Dual Vocational Education and Training schools. The results showed that the level of digital competence shown was medium to low across all dimensions. With regard to the age factor, only the problem-solving dimension was found to be age-dependent. © 2020 The Author(s).

This study has both, a qualitative and field approach which a total of 119 students and 11 professors from the Textile Confection career were surveyed of a total of 519 students and 26 professors belonging to several careers from “Instituto Superior Tecnológico Cotacachi” with tools that allow to know the different aspects related to skills, use, media design and techniques in educational environment using through ICT and the students’ self-perception. The main objective is to diagnose the use and integration of ICT during the learning process of the career mentioned before during the academic period November 2019–April 2019. The results indicate that most of the professors have ICT skills in several variables. However, direct-observation results reveal a few pedagogical praxis deficiencies using information and communication technologies. On the other hand, students exhibit serious deficiencies when it comes to their digital and TIC abilities, presenting future issues employment for the future professionals in the Textile Confection career, creating a starting point in the academic decision-making process made by authorities and faculty. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Digital competences; Dual training; Education; ICT; Textile confection","Decision making; Education; Information use; Sustainable development; Textiles; Decision making process; Digital competences; Direct observations; Educational environment; Information and Communication Technologies; Learning process; Several variables; Skills and competences; Students","","","","","","","Del Moral M.E., Villalustre L., University teaching in the 2.0 era: Virtual campus teaching competences.

It is proved that the dual education system is more in demand and most effective in terms of the development of students' professional mobility. In the dual education system, student mobility is the result of the interconnected activities of a professional educational organization and a base enterprise. The main signs of students' professional mobility are their ability to change the place and type of professional activity, depending on the conditions of its implementation and the characteristics of situations resolved in the process of professional activity. The solution to the development problem of students' professional mobility at secondary vocational education organizations is carried out within the framework of the concept according to which vocational education is implemented by organizing in the interconnection of educational, cognitive, educational, professional and professional activities of students. The development effectiveness of students' professional mobility is ensured by the implementation of a set of organizational and pedagogical conditions, which are based on the selected objective laws of the dual education system. By the method of pedagogical experiment it was established that the development of students' professional mobility is of a level nature. The main criterion for assessing the level is the students' willingness to carry out professional activities in various conditions and situations. By the method of comparative analysis of the experimental results, it was proved that with traditional vocational training, the majority of students are at low and medium levels of professional mobility development (from 39.5% to 58.3%), with dual education - at medium and high levels of development (from 27, 9% to 55.8%). © 2020 LLC Ecological Help.

The Upper Secondary Industry Apprenticeship program [PIMA] was implemented in vocational schools in 2010 as an extension to the industrial apprenticeship program. This industrial training is a career transition to prepare students for the workforce. In the context of special education students, they are also required to seek relevant knowledge and training so that they could acquire a career. Industrial training should provide an equal opportunity of education for diverse students as stipulated in the Malaysia Education Blueprint 2013 to 2025. Industrial training plays an important role in enhancing students' career well-being and helps develop their potential, interests, and skills. The purpose of this paper is to assess the implementation of industrial training for students with disabilities. It is also designed to examine the role of adaptability in enhancing their workplace well-being.

The professionalism of future teachers of training is of priority importance, and its formation is a necessary condition for the intensification of education. The scientific search for a solution to the problem of the formation of professionalism among future teachers of training is aimed at resolving the contradictions between: - the need of society for training specialists with a high level of professionalism and an insufficient level of their professional training; the need for personnel with a high> level of professionalism, and the undeveloped process of forming the professionalism of teachers of training at a university; the practical need for the purposeful development of the professionalism of future teachers and the existing conditions for organizing their professional development in an engineering and pedagogical university; the expediency of creating a developmental space and the existing traditional approach to the development of professionalism among future teachers of training at a university. This research aims to analyze future pedagogy teachers' readiness formation in dual-oriented education. It is possible to resolve these contradictions based on scientific support for the integration process of development and formation of the personality of the future teacher. With regard to the topic of the research, we are talking about rethinking the goals and social essence of the training process. In this paper, we have analyzed the training programmes offered to the teachers, surveying the effects and benefits of professional advancement on creating new knowledge and improving the quality of teaching. The survey results have verified the main hypothesis regarding the effect of professional readiness development in raising the quality of teaching, but they have not verified a completely auxiliary hypothesis that views (considers) as a mechanism to meet the professional development needs of teachers. © 2020 Lifescience Global","dual education; Kazakhstan; Professional; teachers; training","article; education; human; human experiment; Kazakhstan; pedagogics; personality; process development; professional development; teacher; teaching","","","","","","","Belyaeva AP., Integrative theory and practice of multilevel continuous professional education, (2002); Yu G, Tatur M., Higher.

Organisation flexibility can only be achieved when they have a strong foundation of Cyber professionals that can look after vulnerabilities and protect their systems. A multitude of evidence suggests that the economy is being held back due to a skills gap, particularly in the Cyber Security discipline. In seeking to reduce this gap, the UK government has extended a long established ‘apprenticeship’ programme to include degrees. Higher Education Degree Apprenticeships offer a cost-effective route for employers to upskill their staff and for apprentices to access free education (and a degree) whilst being paid. Each of the Degree Apprenticeships has an associated framework that defines core learning requirements – devised and created by a collaborative effort of industry and academia. How this framework is implemented however is very much up to individual institutions. This paper presents an implementation of the Cyber Security Analyst degree apprenticeship undertaken at a UK Institution. Amongst the first in the UK to operationalise the standard, the approach has pragmatically dealt with a wide range of issues to create an academically rigorous yet commercially viable solution for industry. The paper presents the approach, demonstrates the academic rigor through mapping to industry-accepted standards, and discusses the collaborative role of the employer and University in providing a holistic and complete learning experience. The paper concludes by offering a critical discussion on challenges and opportunities and suggests ways employers and professional bodies can collaborate further with Higher Education in developing Degree Apprenticeships that will only be about skills, but also lifelong learning. © 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","","Cost effectiveness; Security of data; Cost effective; Critical discussions; Cyber-security educations; Digital transformation; Higher education; Learning experiences; Life long learning; Viable solutions; Apprentices","","","","","","","Embedding Employability in Higher Education, (2015); Anderson A., Bravenboer D., Hemsworth D., The role of universities in higher apprenticeship development, High.

However, the dropping out of DVE students is still ongoing. The government and the industrial and service sectors will, therefore, suffer economic loss through waste of investment in education coupled with economic loss to the country in various ways. Therefore, this study aimed to find the causes of student dropout from DVE programs in Thailand by using qualitative method research with in-depth interviews with 40 key informants, covering four regions of Thailand, who are stakeholders in the DVE system. The data were analysed thematically by the three-step research process for qualitative lesson research. The research results show that the causes of student dropout from DVE programs are mainly because DVE students of certificate level, age between 16-18 years old, have low maturity in the control of emotions, adaptation to society, and making rational decisions to solve problems, followed by establishments in Thailand not yet understanding the patterns, procedures, or processes of DVE as they should; the third cause is family, because student family conditions may affect the mind and concentration of the student, and the last one are vocational training schools, who may have policies, systems, regulations, and guidelines for managing DVE that are unclear or not as conducive to success for DVE students. Therefore, teachers, establishments, students, and parents should bring research results to create a system for the screening, preventing, and solving problems of student dropout from DVE programs and reducing the waste of investment in education by the state and economic losses to the country. © Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Publisher’s Office.","Dual vocational education; Qualitative research; Student dropout","","","","","","","","Developing adolescents: a reference for professionals, (2002); Sonnin Banleng, Research report: path to vocational education and technology, (2005); Bejakovic P., Education, Employability and labour force competitiveness in Croatia, Problems of education in the 21st century, 58, 1, pp. 13-26, (2014); Cohen Bruce J., Orbuch Terri L., Introduction to Sociology, (1990); Dmitrienko N.A., Gorbina M.A., Porozhnyak N.F., Trusova T.V., Konovalenko T.

A mixed methodology was used applying a survey questionnaire to students and interviews with course and class directors, to verify to what extent these courses meet the goals set for their creation. Through this data analysis and interpretation, it is clear that students perceived the course as easy and motivating, due to its practical nature and its potential for access to the labour market. They also valued the competence and performance of the teachers who teach these courses. These directors also emphasized that the vocational school dropout numbers are related to the excessive theoretical content, a view that is supported by students. Nevertheless, it can be observed that the success rates are significant, fulfilling one of the main objectives that were outlined for these courses. © 2020, Arizona State University.

This study assumes a quasi-experimental cross section. For the estimation of the impact the Propensity Score Matching was used, which also uses three algorithms: the nearest neighbor, the radio and the kernel matching, and, the analysis of regression scores as well. The two approaches: Propensity Score Matching and regression score analysis, as in the three algorithms, give solid results as a contribution it was evidenced that the graduates who participate in the dual program have a significantly higher salary ($ 275.00 USD) and a shorter time (2 months 20 days) in inserting in the labor market with respect to those who did not receive the program (Traditional model). © 2020 Research Center of Universidad Pedagogica Nacional.
